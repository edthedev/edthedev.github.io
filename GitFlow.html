# Git Flow

Presented by [Edward Delaporte](mailto:edward.delaporte@busey.com) 
for [Busey Bank](https://www.busey.com)

This slide deck is online at http://edward.delaporte.us

???
- Why Git?
- Why Git flow? Everybody is doing it.
- Annecodate about the Git vs Mercurial poll.

---

# What makes Git different?

- Distributed
- Works fine in local-only mode
- Supports Branches
- Merge actually works a lot of the time.

---

# Sources of Confusion

- To *Commit* creates a *Commit*.
- Visual Studio frequently refuses instructions when there are *changes* that have not been turned into 'commits'.
- This is because all Git operations act on *commits*, so Git is pretty useless around uncommitted changes.
- All commits are reversible.

???
- Sometimes it is worthwhile to *commmit* unwanted changes and then revert the created *commit*, rather than trying to back them out.
- Git assumes you know you can just revert your commit, and so sometimes expects you to do dumb things...

---

# Understanding the Stage

![Git Stage](stage.png)

???
- The stage controls what goes in a commit.
- Commits are created completely locally.
- .git folder is where your commits actually are.
- You can track and reverse your changes while offline, even check out other branches.

# Common Branch Names in Git Flow

- feature (aka backlog)
- master (aka production)
- hotfix (aka bug fix)
- develop (aka merge nightmare)
- tags (aka where did I put that, anyway?)

???

- Explain purpose of each.
- Git Flow is a technique that helps avoid breaking develop and master.
- Your colleagues will only notice if you break develop or master.
