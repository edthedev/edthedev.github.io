### Editing

+ Original editing was done in Vim.
+ Recently I have been using Visual Studio Code with the delightful VsVim plugin.
+ When I want a really focused editing experience, I use my [Journal Pi Setup](../pi/)

### Art
Most art was done on an iPad.
The fish bowl was mostly done on a Wacom Bamboo tablet, which I do not recommend, due to the surpressingly small sensitivity area. I understand it has been discontinued, so Wacom agrees. More recent art may have been done on a Huion 610 Pro Tablet or Microsoft Surface Go.
