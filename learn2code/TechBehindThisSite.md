### Editing
Original editing was done in Vim.
Recently I have been using Visual Studio Code with the delightful VsVim plugin.
I keep trying to map new helpful functions to keyboard shortcuts in Visual Studio Code, only to find that native shortcuts exist. I haven't been this delighted discovering an editor since Vim, and before that Visual Studio.
Sorry Emacs, maybe someday. But I bet Org Mode for Visual Studio Code is coming soon...

### Art
Most art was done on an iPad.
The fish bowl was mostly done on a Wacom Bamboo tablet, which I do not recommend, due to the surpressingly small sensitivity area. I understand it has been discontinued, so Wacom agrees. More recent art may have been done on a Huion 610 Pro Tablet or Microsoft Surface Go.
