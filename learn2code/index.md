## MIT Scratch

[MIT Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tutorial=home) is the original block based code learning environment.

I think it's still the most feature complete. The ability to add animations, backgrounds and custom recorded sounds makes this a stronger creative toy than a lot of others.

Scratch also has a built in video tutorial series that explores a bunch of great computer science concepts.

Let me know if you enjoy [my humble Scratch creations](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/edthedev/).

## MakeCode Arcade & Meowbit

> Kids need shelter, food, love, and a hand-held video game player that they can write their own games for.

[MeowBit](https://www.amazon.com/Kittenbot-Card-Sized-Computer-Microsoft-Compatible/dp/B07QNTSSYP) is a hand-held video game that a kid can write code for using a snap-block language.

Even without the device, kids can get started using the online emulator and [MakeCode Arcade Tutorials](https://arcade.makecode.com/).

I made a game called [Monkey Treasure Hunt](https://makecode.com/_TWAV1bia4Jcd).

And a better game than mine:

## Robots in MineTest

If I told you there was a free clone of `MineCraft` that allowed players to build and program robots, would you even finish reading this page?

Everyone should get to play with [Robots in MineTest](/blog/minetest/robots).

## Create Retro Python Games using Pyxel

[Pyxel]() is a retro game platform that supports coding in Python. Unlike other Python game libraries, Pyxel provides a curated experience for new game developers.

I have created a few [Pyxel Tutorials](/pyxel).

## Minecraft Puzzles

For a cool guided learning experience, consider [Minecraft on Code.org](https://studio.code.org/s/hero/stage/1/puzzle/1) - a fantastic guided learn-to-code series.

It has a Minecraft theme, stars YouTube celebrities, and has a plot. Along the way, kids get to control Steve while programming a robot ally to solve puzzles.

Note that this is a two-dimensional game. For a full 3D experience, try out [MineTest with Robots](/blog/minetest/robots).

## Code.org

[Code.org](https://code.org) also has a lot more than just Minecraft puzzles.

## Real Robots!!! with BBC Micro:Bit

For about $60.00 (one MicroBit and one CuteBot), your kid can have a robot trucking around the room, following code they wrote. Consider getting an extra MicroBit to act as a remote control via Bluetooth.

[BBC Micro:Bit](https://makecode.microbit.org/) is currently the most afordable hardware I have found that can run block code.

It comes with bunch of LEDs, a couple of buttons, a bluetooth radio, and a connector for an always growing set of add-on boards.

[CuteBot](https://www.elecfreaks.com/learn-en/microbitKit/smart_cutebot/cutebot_car.html) is currently my favorite affordable robot frame. 

## p5.js

[P5.js](https://p5js.org/learn/) is a fun web-based way to experiment with both JavaScript and drawing with code at the same time.

You can read the source code of [my live interactive art](/art/live) for some ideas.
