## Learn to Code

### MIT Scratch

https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tutorial=home

The original block based code learning environment.

I think it's still the most feature complete. The ability to add animations, backgrounds and sounds makes this a stronger creative toy than a lot of others.

I did not find a satisfactory Zero-to-Basics lesson plan, so I wrote my own.
It is open source. Feel free to use it, reemix it, and teach with it.

### Minecraft Puzzles

My favorite guided learn-to-code series.
You get the Minecraft theme, YouTube celebrities, a plot, and your own robot to program while solving puzzles.

### BBC Micro:Bit

The most afordable hardware you can run block code on. 
You get a bunch of LEDs, a couple of button, a radio, and a connector for an always growing set of add-on boards.

### Algorithm Ink

[Algorithm Ink](http://azarask.in/projects/algorithm-ink/#0656fbe7) is a beautiful way to experiment with code and art.

### Code.org

After you finish the Minecraft tutorial, check this out for a lot more resources.
