## Learn to Code

### Minecraft Puzzles

[Minecraft on Code.org](https://studio.code.org/s/hero/stage/1/puzzle/1) is my favorite guided learn-to-code series.

It has a Minecraft theme, stars YouTube celebrities, and has a plot. Along the way, kids get to control Steve while programming a robot ally to solve puzzles.

### MakeCode Arcade & Meowbit

Kids need shelter, food, love, and a hand-held that they can write their own games for.

[MeowBit](https://www.amazon.com/Kittenbot-Card-Sized-Computer-Microsoft-Compatible/dp/B07QNTSSYP) is a hand-held video game that a kid can write code for using a snap-block language.

Even without the device, kids can get started using the online emulator and [MakeCode Arcade Tutorials](https://arcade.makecode.com/).

### MIT Scratch

[MIT Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tutorial=home) is the original block based code learning environment.

I think it's still the most feature complete. The ability to add animations, backgrounds and custom recorded sounds makes this a stronger creative toy than a lot of others.

Scratch also has a built in video tutorial series that explores a bunch of great computer science concepts.

Let me know if you enjoy [my humble Scratch creations](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/edthedev/).

### Robots!!! with BBC Micro:Bit

For about $60.00 (one MicroBit and one CuteBot), your kid can have a robot trucking around the room, following code they wrote. Consider getting an extra MicroBit to act as a remote control via Bluetooth.

[BBC Micro:Bit](https://makecode.microbit.org/) is currently the most afordable hardware I have found that can run block code.

It comes with bunch of LEDs, a couple of buttons, a bluetooth radio, and a connector for an always growing set of add-on boards.

[CuteBot](https://www.elecfreaks.com/learn-en/microbitKit/smart_cutebot/cutebot_car.html) is currently my favorite affordable robot frame. 



### Code.org

[Code.org](https://code.org) also has a lot more than just Minecraft puzzles.
