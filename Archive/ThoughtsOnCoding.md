It’s a lot easier to write software in a noise-free environment, or predictable consistent background noise. A good set of headphones is a must, and an iPod application or two can be really handy.

White Noise by TMSoft is currently my favorite. Their boat rocking, railroad tracks bumps and various types of rain are great for relaxing just the right amount.

I also highly recommend the ‘Pirates of the Caribbean’ movie sound track, and just about anything composed by John Williams.

Update: My friend Rob pointed me to the incredibly awesome Trance Around the World Podcast. Highly recommended.

## Declarative Programming

Declarative programming
This article has a cool description of something I’ve been working on in my own programming style lately:

If code describes intent, rather than incidentals, it will better stand the test of time.

I figure it also gives each compiler a better chance to optimize for whatever exotic chip-set the code someday runs on.

## ‘Privacy’ is not the same as ‘secret’.

Bruce Schneier says that keeping things private is not the same thing as keeping them secret.

## $180 million per year scam software company

A company earned $180 million in a year by publishing scare-ware scam software. From the article, this company had a human resources department, a dedicated IT team, and a full call center. Evil software is now a large and profitable business: www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE62N29T20100324 As this trend continues, it’s going to get harder to tell the online bad guys apart from legitimate businesses. Maybe the public will finally learn how to use the trust technologies that have been available for many years.

## Microsoft Small Basic

I have been hunting for a language to just play with for a long time now. (Pretty much ever since Python became my primary programming language at work.) I want a language that I can write quick simple expressive toys in; and then post them (both source and executable) to share with friends. I want a language to socialize in. (You will never hear another programmer say that, I betcha.)

2019 March Update: There are so many great options for this now! MIT Scratch has been a favorite. I wish FriendShipIsMagic++ ran more places. BBC Mirco:Bit is rapidly becoming a new favorite.

## If you’re thinking of using isInstanceo

Think again.

## Open Source Electorate

Without mind-reading it’s impossible to fully audit the motives and rationality of our elected representatives. And even if we find them lacking, it can be hard to get rid of them or force them to change with the times. And once we’ve gotten rid of a flawed one, it’s hard to find a suitably qualified replacement.

Open source software addresses all of these problems. Because it’s open, disagreeing parties can fully examine it’s rationale and have an open discussion of possible solutions. Flawed code can be patched or branched. And even when a piece of code is ready for retirement, it’s replacement can benefit greatly from reading the original source.

So I propose that we open our governing seats to open source artificial intelligences that can pass the Turing test. The salary normally paid for the position will now be used to purchase a short term support contract.

Update policies, patching schedules and service response times will be determined at election time, by way of campaign promises. And since all eligible candidates must be open source, it will be possible to re-elect the same piece of code, but with a different support company.

## My favorite hacks

To the tune of ‘My Favorite Things’, from *The Sound of Music*.

Pointers to pointers, And references dereferenced, C strings escaped, and a registry preferenced. Serialized instances sorted in stacks, These are a few of my favorite hacks.

(chorus) When the thread locks, and MEM hits max. when I’m out of luck… I simply remember my favorite hacks, and then I don’t feel so stuck.

Wix MSI and some installs by OneClick. Registry rollback when PC is a brick.

Backgrounded install for all service packs, These are a few of my favorite hacks.

(repeat chorus)

127.zero.oh-one Localhost loopback and self-serving test runs.

Localized SqlLite storing some MACs. These are a few of my favorite hacks.

(repeat chorus)

Shared folder data, import through a spreadsheet, WordMerge then parse back, and upload and repeat. Specialized servers turn emails to fax. These are a few of my favorite hacks.

(repeat chorus)

Php Escape string, and regex in taint mode, use strict or warning, but never use globals.

Update your language or suffer attacks, these are a few of my favorite hacks.

2019 March Update: Writing an MSI with Wix will do weird things to your head. I need to add some verses, as I have lots of new favorite hacks in the years since I wrote this.



## Castor on troubled waters
As long as I’m thinking about my absolute favorite podcasts, let me post another that I am sure to recommend in person sometime.

‘Castor on troubled waters’ is a grandiose pirate tale that spans decades, but takes just a few minutes to enjoy. If you enjoy a vivid imagination and a clever hero, this could become your favorite fish story just as it became mine!

## Dybbuk in the bottle
I’ve been really enjoying listening to the free fiction audio podcasts over at Podcastle and EscapePod.

I’m posting a link to this story because I’m certain to bring it up in conversation sometime, and this way one of us can just surf over to EdTheDev.com to dig up the link.

‘Dybbuk in the bottle’ is a fable about a a contest between a Jewish farmer and a demon. The ending is just as satisfying as any fable you have ever heard; but it’s the quality of the storytelling along the way that really sets it apart.

## TiddlyWiki Mac Widget
This makes me unspeakably happy. TiddlyWiki is the coolest way to track your random stray thoughts. It’s a Wiki that runs entirely out of a flat file on your computer, in your browser.

Jonathan Paisley has taken TiddlyWiki to it’s next step in awesomeness, by turning it into a Mac Widget.

You can download it form his website at: TiddlyWiki Things.

2019 March Update: Browsers have so many security updates making TiddlyWiki hard to use, now.

## Google Result Hijacking

2009 May 

Yahoo Tech News reports that a virus called ‘Gumblar’ is usurping control of vulnerable websites and then vulnerable home computers that visit those websites. Once installed, it redirects your Internet Explorer Google search results to spam pages or more virus delivery pages.

This is a classic technique, not a new one; but the article is a nice way to learn about it.

The most important thing to note is that ‘Gumblar’ is targeting vulnerabilities that are almost a year old now. In a sane world, that wouldn’t work because everyone would apply security patches. In the real world it works just fine. Applying software updates is the digital equivalent of washing your hands. Knowing that some of your neighbors don’t even do it once a year is incentive to take extra care with your own computers.

## Reading – 7 Habits of Highly Effective People
I’m playing with my new Amazon WordPress add-on.

 I’m currently reading ‘The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People’. It’s full of great advice, but don’t expect to read it through in one sitting. It’s a good pick-up and put-down book. I like reading it in ten minute intervals; taking time in between to internalize it’s advice.

 ## Is Firefox More Secure?
Yep. Firefox is more secure.

## Mac Security
Apple Insider has a nice article about Mac security. AppleInsider interviewed hackers and security experts about why Mac’s are considered safer than Windows. The conclusion is that Macs are much easier to compromise than PCs, but just aren’t worth the trouble due to their lack of market position.

My favorite article highlights follow. Disclaimer: I run both Windows and Linux, and look forward to purchasing a Mac soon. I respect the security teams behind all of these products. There are good reasons why the products work they ways they do. Until the day when all are perfectly secure, anything you can learn about their security models helps.

At Pwn2Own, the $5,000 prize for hacking the Mac was collected within seconds of the contest starting. The winner, who also won last year, hinted that he had a large array of working hacks ready, and the first hack just happened to work on the first try.

The $10,000 prize for hacking the iPhone was not collected; but the rumor mill says that someone had a working hack, but was unwilling to share it for only $10,000.

## Input Awareness
How many ways can malicious input reach your web application? According to OWasp: • Browser input • Cookies • Property files • External processes • Data feeds • Service responses • Flat files • Command line parameters • Environment variables Any of these inputs could be manipulated to be malicious. Be sure to validate all the inputs that your application uses.

## he Changing Fate of Piracy
If you use or know anyone who uses BitTorrent or Limewire, Yahoo Tech News has an article you should read.

The recording industry claims that they’re just in it to educate users. While I doubt the purity of their motives; I believe that the more each consumer knows, the safer they will be. The RIAA still recently stuck by their $150,000 penalty for a single song download, so there is a lot at stake.

I recommend giving the article a quick read. It will help you become familiar with the issues, and with why and how piracy is changing. As you read, consider how much you trust your ISP. I encourage you to trust your service provider, but trust them appropriately by knowing their policies.

## April 1 Virus
Are you wondering whether you should be worried about the Conficker (also known as Downandup) worm? Are you not even sure what it is?

John Markoff wrote an article for the New York Times explaining what Conficker is, and why people are worried about what it’s going to do on April 1. To learn what all the concern is about, check out John Markoff explains Conficker.

Now that you know what you’re dealing with, you probably want more information. My colleagues at the University of Illinois have gathered some excellent links to Conficker resources. Check out University of Illinois resources for the Conficker Downandup Virus.

## Command Your Computer with Your Voice

2009 March 25

I downloaded the Windows Vista speech recognition update. It works surprisingly well; and it’s the right price too – it’s free.

If you’re using Windows Vista, you should can grab it and give it a try. Download Vista Voice Recognition

Be sure to walk through the tutorial. It’s the easiest way to learn to use it, and the software learns your voice as you work through it – so everyone wins.

Enjoy!

## Ben Writes on Speeding up Vista
Windows Vista isn’t known for making good use of your hardware resources. Many of the applications you install make the problem worse by running all the time, whether you’re using them or not.

If your Vista computer is running slow, you should check out Ben’s illustrated walk-through on Disabling start-up processes in Windows Vista.

## Learn About Hacking with WebScarab
I’m working with some really cool computer security open source tools, and I know some of you will be interested, so I posted a tutorial.

WebScarab is a tool for testing the security of your own web applications, and can teach you a great deal about how the internet works.

Before you try it, you need to know one of the white-hat mantras:

Don’t use these tools on any website other than your own. It is legally equivalent to trying to break someone’s window, and you might succeed.

But I’m not sharing this just to annoy you; you really can use the tools safely and legally. OWasp provides a vulnerable website that you can run from computer, called WebGoat. So you can run and ‘attack’ WebGoat in order to learn WebScarab.

So why learn WebScarab? Because you’ll learn a ton about how HTTP works, how web-servers work, and internet security. Even if you don’t plan to be a professional geek, it’ll make you more savvy and safer online.

The instructions at the OWasp WebScarab Project leave a lot to be desired; so I’ll break it down for you.

Get WebScarab from dawes.za.net/rogan/webscarab/webscarab-current.zip. Extract the zip. Run WebScarab by double clicking the .jar file.

Run Firefox. Configure Webscarab as your Firefox proxy by setting: Tools – Options – Advanced – Connection – Settings – Proxy – LocalHost, 8008

Get WebGoat from code.google.com/p/webgoat/. Extract the zip. Disconnect from the internet (Your computer is very vulnerable while running WebGoat). Run WebGoat by double-clicking the .bat file.

Visit: http://localhost/WebGoat/attack

Login with: user name: webgoat password: webgoat

You will see a brief ‘What is WebGoat’ page. Press the ‘Start WebGoat’ button at the bottom.

Now you will see a page with tutorials that you can walk through with WebGoat and WebScarab. These pages will tell you most of what you need to know.

The YGN Ethical Hacking Group has WebGoat solution videos: ” title=”http://h4k.in/encoding/

## Firefox Mobile Thinks Security First
I tried the alpha version of Fennec, the mobile phone version of Firefox.

I am absolutely thrilled to see that Fennec includes basic browser security from the first pass.

As  you may remember, I don’t use Google Chrome yet; because it lacks basic security features like the ability to selectively enable scripts for trusted pages, and the ability to disable untrusted embedded objects.

Fennec has all of these in the alpha version. Their page says they’re looking for feedback. My feedback is “Nice work folks!”.

Edward
PS I hope that the mouse gesture tool-bars will be added to Firefox soon.

## Take your thumb drive to the next level of productivity

2008 Dec 5

I hope you’re enjoying the thumb drive environment that I showed you how to create. Now I will show you how to make it even better.

I found a better thumb drive application launcher called PStart. I greatly prefer it over PortableAppsLauncher. Both have weaknesses – neither will launch a web link or a Windows Folder from the menu. But PStart will launch a batch file; and that’s enough for me to work around these two problems.

First, you’ll want to use a TiddlyWiki to manage your bookmarks. It’s free. You can launch it from PStart. You can drag new bookmarks into entries in it; you can organize how your favorites are organized, tagged and presented; and it’s fully searchable. Plus, you can choose from a bunch of cool looking TiddlyWiki Themes.

Next, you’ll want EjectUSB – you can launch it from PStart, and it’s far fewer clicks than the standard windows method for safely ejecting your USB drive. Like everything I recommend here, it works on Windows and it’s free.

I also created some batch files to support PStart.

Since I pretty much always need a command prompt and a GUI interface to any folder I’m working with, I created promptandfolder.bat. It opens both a CommandPromptPortable prompt and a Windows Explorer window at the same folder. Save this code into a file named ‘promptandfolder.bat’ in your ‘bin’ directory:

explorer.exe %1
start \PortableApps\CommandPromptPortable\CommandPromptPortable.exe '%1'
REM start powershell.exe -NoExit -Command "cd '%1'"
Remove the ‘REM’ to also start a PowerShell prompt on any computer that has PowerShell available from the path.
If you’re using the Thumb Drive setup that I recommended; put these batch files in you /bin directory; and they will be available from within PortableCommandPrompt in case you want to use them there as well.

When you add these to your PStart menu, put the path you want to launch into the ‘Arguments’ text box.

I created web.bat to hack PStart into letting me add web URLs to my start menu. Just put the URL desired into the ‘Arguments’ text box, and be sure to give each link a meaningful name so that they don’t all list as ‘web.bat’ in the menu. Save this code into a file named ‘web.bat’ in your ‘bin’ directory:

start \PortableApps\FirefoxPortable\FirefoxPortable.exe %1
Enjoy! - Edward

2019 March Update: Interesting that I was already obsessed with being able to code on the go ten years ago, and that PowerShell was already part of the solution.
