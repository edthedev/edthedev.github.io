# Unlocking the Future:
## Identifying, Paying, and Avoiding Technical Debt

Things in CI/CD that reduce the accrual of technical debt:

...list here...

---

## Continuous Delivery / Frequent Deployment

+ Delivery is not Deployment.

???

+ No one needs a firehose of developer cleverness spraying into their production environment.
+ Delivery is not deployment.
+ It takes a computer to really screw things up.

---

## Continuous Delivery / Frequent Deployment

+ Delivery is not Deployment.
+ Let the person who answers the on-call phone push the release button.

???

+ Set the expectation that they push the release button frequently.
+ It takes hard work to be ready to deploy that often.
+ It is worth every minute.

## Continuous Delivery / Frequent Deployment

+ Delivery is not Deployment.
+ Let the person who answers the on-call phone push the release button.
+ One outage can cost a team more time than it takes to setup CI/CD.

???

+ Some of these investments do not pay back in time, but in better outcomes.
+ CI/CD pays back in time.
+ You always get back the time you invest in CI/CD.
+ "But my deployments don't take very long!" 
+ What you're really saying is 
+ "when they don't go completely sideways and disrupt everyone's work for hours or days."

---
+ Continous Delivery - Occassional deployment.
+ Dependabot (KB article here.)
+ Lint/Style tools
+ Automated rebuild with minor releases. Make it one command, or make it automated.
+ Mandatory code review - Tour of GitHub review requiremnts and branch protections here.

???

Ed to pre-record a demo.

+ Aim for 10-12 minutes
+ Proactively pay technical debt via integration documentation, test suites, regression,
CI/CD. (Dependabot)

What to demo:

+ CICD
+ Automated regression tests.
+ Dependabot update pull request.
