# Enhancing the Cybersecurity Program to make University Software Development Safer

---

## BTAA talk thoughts

Build relationships.
Focus first only on tools that being both Cybersecurity and efficiency wins. There will be time for the Cybersecurity win with efficiency loss later, using the efficiencies you help free up now.

---


## The five love languages of software development:

+ Words of affirmation - flatter the teams you want to learn from. Identify them as bright spots and publicly interview then about how they did it.
+ Gifts - pay for tooling, and submit pull requests. Make CICD the priority - then add static code analysis, code review standards, automated testing, and ChatOps for security gains.
+ Touch - nope.
+ Acts of service - be there for them with highly available expertise. (HA has a staffing cost.)
+  Quality time - join their stand ups. Demand that they follow your (and industry prescribed best practices) for agile. Once they do, join their agile scrum.

---

Todo: section explaining all the security wins in a strong CICD pipeline.

Lessons:
+ It was good to have a software product to rally around and practice on, but the real product is the program.
+ Demand agile practices before engaging - git use, a backlog, daily stand ups, a change log, etc. Doesn't have to be perfect, but if the team has no respect for their own time, they will be unable to respect your team's time.
+ Use git. It is now a protocol, not just free a tool. You must have support for the leading collaboration protocol to succeed.
+ This is a QA team.
+ This is an IAM team.
+ Boy do changelogs pay off. If you only do one thing - start enforcing changelogs.
+ bias toward open source - we are a small team and don't write much - guideline towards btaa contribution - particularly around IAM and QA.

Offer of mentorship - it pays off. A national program can take much higher swings than a local one.

## Two

???

+ Development done better. Mentorship.
+ Mentorship doesn't just mean better code - it can mean less code, more of the necessary code, etc.
+ 2800x faster security patch response time with a CICD pipeline and ChatOps in place.
