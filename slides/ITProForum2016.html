Server deployments are like push-ups:
- Form matters. 
- It's not enough to get the weight there. 
- How you get it there determines whether you are going to be in a lot of pain later.
- More=Better. There is no substitute for repetition.
- If you do them right, your capacity increases over time. 
- You are better off with a spotter. Collaborate. Have someone check your work.
Conclusion:
- It's about not dropping things.
- The way to know you won't drop it when it matters is to do it again and again and again.

## What is Ansible

- [Simple IT Automation](https://www.ansible.com/)
- Configuration
- Deployment

???

    Introduce/ explain the name Ansible
Our Experience with Ansible

## Why Bother With Ansible?

### As a Developer
- I love pushing a big red button and watching my code go live.
- I value *not* being called by my admin between 4 am and 6 am.
- I need to know that the problem I am hunting was not caused by the deployment.

### As an Administrator
- I love parallel efficiency.
- I value stable custom configuration.
- I need repeatability. 


???

I want you to have a solid deploymemt plan.

3/4 of all the headaches I've experienced
were when we had a solution, but didn't have a timely, effective way to deploy it.

I might work on something for you or someone who you mentored, someday.

Teaching people one by one by one isn't scaling effectively. 

I hope you will spread the good news that deployments don't have to be unreliable and painful.

Idea: Add photo of Big Red Button

Developer says: 
File copy is reliable and repeatable, but deployment is a lot more than file copy.
Deployment is: file copy, permissions, web config, app config, host dependencies, host config

Admin says:
The desired state needs to be achieved, no matter how many times I apply a configuration. 
Shells are limited by their environment and available commands. Ansible can do anything python or bash or PowerShell can do.

## Why Bother With Ansible?

```BASH
  make update APP=goals BRANCH=hotfix_1.0.2
```

## Things Ansible Does
- Update a custom web app
- Harden security settings
- Install EPEL
- Setup networking
- Provision a new AWS host!
- Create user accounts
- Update Windows (New!)

???
???
 (Add lots of Examples)

---
## Get Started with AWS

- Create an Amazon Web Services account
- Configure your default external 'firewall' under EC2 -> Security Groups
---

## Get Started with Ansible

- [Install Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html) on the Ansible Control Machine
- Write your [Inventory File](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_inventory.html) on the Ansible Control Machine
- Set up SSH Access to the target machine.
- Set up Sudo rights on the target machine (for most tasks)
- Tweak Ansible config file. /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
- [Ansible Command Line Reference for Ad Hoc commands](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_adhoc.html)

???
???


Tips
- All you need is SSH Access and Sudo rights on the target.
- You need sudo access as normal on the target (most configurations)
- AWS = Amazon Web Services
- pip install boto on the Ansible control machine / hive queen
- Usually start with Root password.
- For AWS, use AWS user secret and secret key as ENV variables or modules arguments.

---

## Example Ansible Inventory File

```BASH
[home]
shockwave
ratchet
admins-mac-mini.local
minecraft.delaporte.us

[vagrant]
192.168.33.10

[remote]
learn.delaporte.us
ansible-chicago-apps
```

???
???

- Anything that SSH can resolve works.
- Short name, IP, FQDN all work.
- .ssh/config short names also work.
- Works with localhost screwy networked virtual machines, too.

---

## Getting Things Done with Ansible

### Start Using Playbooks
Install a Role:
```BASH
	ansible-galaxy install burtvv.bind
```

Run a Playbook:
```BASH
	ansible-playbook -VVVV playbook.yml
```



???

Ansible Galaxy Role
- Is a directory.
- Includes: variables, handlers, tasks, templates
- templates are Jinja templates (typically for config files)

Ansible Playbook
- is a YAML file
- includes ansible commands to run
- Some commands are included with Ansible.
- Some commands will come from roles you have installed.
- -VVVV looks like the SSH verbosity flag.
- Becuase it is the SSH verbosity flag.

Ansible Users Linked
- Jeff Gearling wrote the book on Ansible
- Burt VV has a lot of Enterprise Linux Playbooks for Tomcat, Apache, Bind, Pxe(pixy)


Give example commands to contribute to an Ansible Galaxy playbook.
    Or Link to a Guide to Git? (Use it to track / share your own work.)

Maybe: Add a slide after this on configuring Ansible.
- Configure non-root sudoer (necessary on Amazon)
- You can have multiple roles paths...
- Configure location of hosts file.

---

#### Ansible Playbook - Deploy a Custom Web App

Command
```BASH
  make update APP=goals
  make fix APP=goals BRANCH=hotfix_1.0.2
```

Makefile
```BASH
HOSTNAME=ansible-chicago-apps
BRANCH=master
PLAYBOOK=playbook.yml
VERBOSE="-v"
# VERBOSE="-vvvv"

ifeq ($(APP),goals)
	REPO=git@bitbucket.org:edthedev/goals.git
	FQDN=mygoal.space
endif

update:
	ansible-playbook --tags=update $(VERBOSE) $(PLAYBOOK) 
  --extra-vars="branch=$(BRANCH) hosts=$(HOSTNAME) git_repo=$(REPO) fqdn=$(FQDN)"

fix:
	ansible-playbook --tags=fixed $(VERBOSE) $(PLAYBOOK) 
  --extra-vars="branch=$(BRANCH) hosts=$(HOSTNAME) git_repo=$(REPO) fqdn=$(FQDN)"

```


???

- I use a Makefile to group up sets of options. 
- There is probably a much more professional way to do this.
- Fix is a tag I apply to a sub-set of the total steps in the Playbook
- I use a Makefile as a way to let teammates see what commands I typically run

---

#### Ansible Playbook - Deploy a Custom Web App

playbook.yml - Make the Target Become a Web Server
```YAML
- hosts: "{{ hosts }}"
  vars:
    - app_name: "{{ app }}"
    - app_home: "/var/www/{{ app_name }}"
    - app_wsgi: "{{ app_home }}/app.wsgi"
    - git_branch: "{{ branch }}"
  tasks:
    - yum:
        name="{{ item }}"
        state=installed
      with_items:
        - "{{ httpd_service }}"
        - epel-release
        - git
        - mod_wsgi
        - python-pip
        - openssl
        - mod_ssl
    - file:
        state=link
        src=/usr/share/zoneinfo/America/Chicago
        dest=/etc/localtime
        force=yes
```

???

- Set variables at the top for reuse.
- Pass in variables on command line.
- I use this to more easily switch between Debian and CentOS
- I tend to use a Makefile as my starting point. "make update"


---

#### Ansible Playbook - Deploy a Custom Web App

playbook.yml - Install Our Custom Python App on the Target
```YAML
    - name: install app source code
	  git: 
        dest="{{ app_home }}" 
        repo="{{ git_repo }}"
        update=yes
        force=yes
        depth=1
        version="{{ git_branch }}"
        accept_hostkey=True
      notify: restart_apache
      tags: update
    - name: app readable by apache
      file: 
        path="{{ app_home }}"
        group="{{ httpd_group }}"
        recurse=yes
        mode=776
    - name: install prerequisites
	  pip: 
        # executable="/usr/bin/pip-3.2"
        requirements="{{ app_home }}/requirements.txt"
```

---


#### Ansible Playbook - Deploy a Custom Web App

playbook.yml - Configure Apache on the Target
```YAML
    - template: src="{{ conf_temp }}" dest="{{ httpd_sites }}/{{ app_name }}.conf"
      notify: restart_apache
      tags: update
    - name: use new config file
      lineinfile:
        dest="{{ httpd_conf }}"
        state=present
        line="include {{ httpd_sites }}/{{ app_name }}.conf"
      notify: restart_apache
    - name: Listen on port 443
      lineinfile:
        dest="{{ httpd_conf }}"
        state=present
        line='Listen 443'
      notify: restart_apache
  handlers:
    - name: restart_apache
      service: name="{{ httpd_service }}" state=restarted
      tags: fixed
```

### First Break for Questions

<img src="static/img/bigredbutton_open.png" />


---

#### Ansible Playbook - Provision an AWS Host

```YAML
---
- hosts: localhost
  become: no
  vars_files:
  - vars/aws_cli_credentials.yml
  - vars/aws_allinone.yml
  - vars/ec2_micro_centos7.yml
  - name: provision a new instance with swap and log volumes
    ec2:      
      image: "{{ aws_image }}"
      instance_type: "{{ aws_instance_type }}"
      aws_access_key: "{{ aws_access_key }}"
      aws_secret_key: "{{ aws_secret_key }}"
      keypair: "{{ aws_keypair }}"
      count: 1
      instance_tags: "{'Name': 'examplehost','client':'{{ansible_user_id}}','role':'aws_allinone' }"
      region: "{{ aws_region }}"
      groups: ['default', 'aws_allinone']
      vpc_subnet_id: "{{ aws_vpc_subnet }}"
      wait: true
      volumes:
      - device_name: /dev/xvds
        volume_type: gp2
        volume_size: 4
		# ...
    register: ec2_info

```

???

Probably worth talking about:
    ec2_group:
    ec2_snapshot:

---

#### Ansible Playbook - Provision an AWS Host

```YAML
  - name: associate reserved elastic ip to the new instance
    ec2_eip:
      in_vpc: true
      device_id: "{{item.id}}"
      public_ip: "{{ hostvars['examplehost']['ansible_host'] }}"
      reuse_existing_ip_allowed: yes
      region: "{{aws_region}}"
    with_items:
    - "{{ ec2_info.instances }}"

  - name: wait for instance to listen on port:22
    wait_for:
      state: started
      host: "{{ hostvars['examplehost']['ansible_host'] }}"
      port: 22
 
  - name: wait for boot process to finish
    pause: minutes=2
```

???
- Let's make it so we can reach it...
- Notice we wait for it to boot before we continue...

---

#### Ansible Playbook - Provision an AWS Host

```YAML
- hosts: aws_allinone
  become: yes
  vars_files:
  - vars/aws_allinone.yml
  pre_tasks:
  - name: install useful packages
    package: 
      name: "{{ item }}" 
      state: present
    with_items:
    - vim
    - lvm2
```

???

- Skip the traditional loss of train of thought because some important tool is not installed.

---

#### Ansible Playbook - Provision an AWS Host

```YAML
  - name: set hostname for AWS host
    hostname:
      name: "{{inventory_hostname}}.{{domain|lower}}"

  - name: add hostname to network file
    lineinfile:
      dest: /etc/sysconfig/network
      line: "HOSTNAME={{ inventory_hostname }}.{{domain|lower}}"

  - name: change cloud init to preserve hostname
    lineinfile:
      dest: /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg
      insertbefore: EOF
      line: "preserve_hostname: true"
```

???

- Set a host name 
- Make AWS respect the host name 

---

#### Ansible Playbook - Provision an AWS Host

```YAML
  - name: make swap volume
    shell: "mkswap /dev/xvds"
    ignore_errors: yes
  
  - name: turn on swap volume
    shell: "swapon /dev/xvds"
    ignore_errors: yes
  
  - name: add swap to fstab
    mount: 
      state: present
      src: /dev/xvds
      name: swap
      fstype: swap
      passno: 0
      dump: 0
```

???

Swap can be nice.
We are skipping over so much in this example.

---

#### Ansible Playbook - Provision an AWS Host

```YAML
#Need to reboot because the lvms won't be recognized until we do.
  - name: Restart server
    command: /sbin/shutdown -r +1
    async: 0
    poll: 0
    ignore_errors: true
 
  - name: wait for instance to listen on port:22
    become: no
    local_action: wait_for 
                  state=started 
                  host="{{ hostvars['examplehost']['ansible_host']}}" 
                  delay=70
                  port=22

  - name: wait for boot process to finish
    pause: minutes=1
```

???

Need to reboot? No problem.

---

#### Ansible Playbook - Provision an AWS Host

```YAML
  post_tasks:
  - name: make sure home directories are mounted
    stat:
      path: /home
      get_md5: False
      get_checksum: False
    register: homedirs
```

---

#### Ansible Playbook - Provision an AWS Host

```YAML
#### CREATE USER DATABASE #######
### uncomment to create users ###

  - name: add users from included play
    include: aws_addusers_include.yml

#### Manage quotacheck #########
  - name: turn quotas off
    command: /sbin/quotaoff -av

  - name: (re)create aquota.user file
    command: /sbin/quotacheck -cu /quotadir

  - name: turn quotas back on
    command: /sbin/quotaon -avu

  - name: create cron job to encourage quotacheck
    blockinfile: 
      dest: /etc/cron.daily/quotacheck
      create: yes
      state: present 
      backup: yes
      marker: "# {mark} ANSIBLE MANAGED BLOCK for quotacheck"
      block: |
        #!/bin/bash
        touch /forcequotacheck
```

???

Hopefully at this point you are remembering all the little things you sometimes forget when setting up a server.

Lesson: Ansible doesn't forget. Ansible removes surprises.

---
#### Ansible Playbook - Provision an AWS Host

```YAML
  - name: install python34
    include: aws_python34.yml
    creates: /bin/pip3
```

???

Include a whole other file full of tasks.
