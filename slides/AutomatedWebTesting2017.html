# How to use ReMark

Open this file in a browser to see the slide deck. Open it in a text editor to work with the Markdown.
Press P to see your presentation notes and a presentation timer.
Press C to clone a copy for your second monitor.
Arrow keys to go forward or back a slide.
Note that both HTML img tags or MarkDown image tags work here, but HTML img tag is easier to style.

# Why Automate Web Testing?

- It takes the Busey team about three hours to manually verify a Property Pay release.

- We release updates about every three weeks.

- The automation runs daily and copies the report output to a network share.

---

# Automation ensures:
- Repeatability: The ability to frequently run tests increases confidence in code correctness.

- Fewer Regressions: Web front-ends and APIs may frequently change. Having tests that can be run quickly helps catch regressions easily.

- Larger test coverage: From form input to page layout, web pages have many fronts for testing. A well-written set of automated tests can cover most of the test features.


???

The Property Pay test suite has about 40 features with varying numbers of steps.

---

# Example Feature File

    Feature: Property Manager uses incorrect password
        In order to ensure that bad passwords are handled correctly
        We step through some tests on the test server.

    Scenario: Property Manager uses incorrect password
        Given the current URL is "PropertyManager/New"
        When we login with <id> and <value>
            | Id       | Value                        |
            | Email    | property_manager@example.com |
            | Password | LOGMEINNOW!                  |
        When we wait 500 milliseconds
        Then the page body contains "invalid login attempt"
        Then we close the browser

???

Talking Points
- Feature description is not used to generate code.
- Key words are Given / When / Then
- Given gets us set up to test.
- When tells testing step.
- Then verifies an expected result.
- Data tables are a fast way to specify a lot of field values.
- The feature steps are written in a language called Gherkin, which allows for the seperation of how the test behaviour is specified from how its implemented.
- So the feature file shown in the previous slide captures the behaviour of what we want to test
- We have 3 implementations - in C#, Python and Ruby - that each test the same feature test but leave the choice of a language up to the tester/programmer.

# Cucumber / Gherkin

- Given
- When
- Then

???

Given
- Call your constructors
- Set up web driver
- Verify pre-conditions (site is up, database state is as needed)

When
- Fill in some fields
- Pick a drop down choice
- Click a button

Then
- Verify expected page content
- Verify expected database content
- Check an inbox for an email
- I usually do cleanup here as well.

# Example C# Step File

    public class WebDriver {

        private string BaseUrl = "https://demo.mypropertypay.com";
        private IWebDriver driver;

        [Given(@"the current URL is ""(.*)""")]
        public void GivenTheCurrentURLIs(string p0) {
            this.driver = new ChromeDriver();
            this.driver.Url = BaseUrl + p0;
        }
    ...
    }

# Another example C# step

        [When(@"we login")]
        public void WhenWeLogin(Table table) {
            IWebElement body = driver.FindElement(By.TagName("body"));
            if (body.Text.ContainsNoCase("log off"))
                driver.FindElement(By.Id("aLogOut")).Click();

            this.fieldValues = table.CreateSet<FieldIdValuePair>();
            foreach(FieldIdValuePair item in this.fieldValues) {
                this.driver.FindElement(By.Id(item.Id)).SendKeys(item.Value);
            }
            driver.FindElement(By.Id("LoginSubmit")).Click();
            System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(500);

# Example Python code

    Setup:
    def before_feature(context):
       context.browser = webdriver.Chrome()

    def after_feature(context, feature):
       context.browser.quit()

    @given("the current URL is \"PropertyManager/New\"")
    def impl(context):
        context = context.browser.get('http://localhost:3333/PropertyManager/New"')

    @when("When we login with {id} and {value}")
    def impl(context, id, value):
       form = context.get_element_by_id(id)
       form.send_keys(value)
       form.submit()

---

# Example Ruby code

    Setup:
    driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :chrome

    @given("the current URL is \"PropertyManager/New\"")
    def impl(context)
        context = driver.navigate_to('http://localhost:3333/PropertyManager/New"')
    end

    @when("When we login with {id} and {value}")
    def impl(context, id, value)
       form = context.find_element(:id, id)
       form.send_keys value
       form.submit
    end

# Discussion Questions for the Panel

- How often do your tests run?
- Who in your organization writes new tests?
- How do you get your test results?
- How often do you add or remove tests from the suite?
- Is any TDD(Test Driven Development) done in organization?
- What percentage of your testing is automated?
- What other kinds of testing and verification do you supplement with?
