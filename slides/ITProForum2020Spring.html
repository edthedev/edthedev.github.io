## Putting the Security in SecDevOps

"Using pipelines, automation and agile practices improve cybersecurity."

**- or -**

***"How I learned to stop worrying and love Pull Requests"***

Presented by:
- Edward Delaporte, Technology Services
- David Riddle, Technology Services
- Michelle Pitcel, Technology Services
- Zachary Carrington, Technology Services
- Tyler Turner, Technology Services

???

Expectations: 
- This will be a whirlwind tour of tools you can try.

We will walk through a high level overview of the ways a DevOps pipeline can make your work day better and while making your products secure - even if the product is from a vendor!

Track: Cloudy with a Chance of Terraforming
2:30 - 3:15 pm - Zoom Room D

## A Vision for **Sec**DevOps

Just add "Sec" to the beginning of everything and call it a day.

## Questions?

## A Vision for **Sec**DevOps

- The three virtues: Laziness, Impatience, Hubris
- Enable Agility and Detective Work
- Start by Gathering Feedback

???

Challenge:
- Complex space.
- Long wishlists.

Today:
- I want to shine a light on the widest path that leads to success.

TRANSITION: That path is **automated feedback**.

---

## Routine Feedback

Better Feedback drives Better Cybersecurity Outcomes
<img class='stretch' src='img/itpro2020spring/BetterBacklogsBetterCybersecurity.PNG'/>

???

- Skimming the surface of this slide today.
- Outcomes are in the lower right...
- The theme in the lower left is "confidence (hubris)".
- The theme of the top half is "laziness"
- It's all about the backlog.

TRANSITION: What does routine feedback look like in technology?

---

### Routine Feedback through CI/CD Pipelines

A GitHub "Pull Request" can automatically gather and present feedback:
<img class='stretch' src='img/itpro2020spring/GitHubFeedback.PNG'/>

???

Get your code changes and their impacts sit side-by-side. 
Even if there are no code changes - just config or a deployment, this pattern still works.

You can automated feedback for:
- Code Test Coverage
- API compatibility (Integration Tests)
- Known Regressions (prevent past bugs)
- Cybersecurity posture (static code scan, external scan)

???

Caffeine break conversations:
- TODO lists
- Journals
- Collaboration Tools

My admission: GitHub

Story: "I voted for a competing tool. I was wrong."

TRANSITION: Where can I get GitHub?

---

## GitHub Enterprise Shared Service

<img class='stretch' src='img/itpro2020spring/UofIGitHub.PNG'/>
- Email the Shared Service team: githubsupport@uillinois.edu
- Website: https://github.uillinois.edu

???

- Per the website: Full Rollout for IT Professionals is happening Summer 2020

TRANSITION: So what does a CI/CD pipeline look like?

---




### Automation with Drone CI / CD

Example `.drone.yml` file:
```YAML
pipeline:
  build:
    image: python:2.7
    commands:
      - apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential python2.7-dev libldap2-dev libsasl2-dev
      - export DOCKER_RUN="bash -c"
      - export PYTHONPATH="$PWD/lib/cites/jira:$PWD/lib/cites/opia"
      - pip install -r requirements.txt
			- $(DOCKER_RUN) 'pytest tests/unit'
			- $(DOCKER_RUN) 'flake8'
```

???

- ADMISSION: Not using GitHub Actions yet. Looking forward to trying.
- supports any command line task
- `pytest`
- `flake8`
- Your commands may vary.
- DO test vendor products - integration testing

TRANSITION: More on unit testing.

---


#### Automated Unit Testing


Pro

 - ***Fast***.
 - Runs anywhere.
 - Answers "What did we expect?"
 - The easiest regression tests are unit tests.

Con

 - Hard to add to Legacy Code
 - Doesn't answer "Why did we do that?"
 - Many **regressions** cannot be unit tested without a refactor.

<img class='stretch' src='img/itpro2020spring/UnitTestExample.PNG'/>

???

- Define **Regression**
- We care about regressions because they are how we prevent repeat bugs.
- Vulnerabilities in the wild are often repeat bugs.

TRANSITION: Visual on Unit Testing

#### Automated Unit Testing

<img class='stretch' src='img/itpro2020spring/UnitTestDiagram.PNG'/>

???

TRANSITION: But I cannot write unit tests for a vendor product.

TRANSITION: How is integration testing different?

---

#### Automated Integration Testing

<img class='stretch' src='img/itpro2020spring/IntegrationTestDiagram.PNG'/>

???

- Blue Box == live test server
- Docker-compose or Terraform or Ansible can help

TRANSITION: Pros and Cons of Integration Testing

---


#### Automated Integration Testing

Pro 

- Catches problems that cross areas.
- The best regression tests are integration tests.

Con

- Depends on external services, configuration, uptime.
- Calls need to be idempotent (repeatable / read-only).

Tools
- API Integration Testing: [Newman with Postman][11]
- Web Interface Integration Testing: [RobotFramework with Selenium][12]

???

- Why integration test?
- Catches what you didn't even think to test for.
- Regressions are much easier to build in integration tests.
- Three major categories: Web, API, Mobile

TRANSITION: API testing with Newman

---

#### Automated API Integration Testing

Newman Example

```powershell
$ newman run mycollection.json -d data.json
```

```powershell
→ Status Code Test
  GET https://echo.getpostman.com/status/404 [404 Not Found, 534B, 1551ms]
  1\. response code is 200

	...
  #  failure        detail

 1\.  AssertionFai…  response code is 200
                    at assertion:1 in test-script
                    inside "Status Code Test" of "Example Collection with
                    Failing Tests"

```

???

- PostMan is an IDE for crafting API tests.
- Newman is the command line runner.
- mycollection.json can be created with PostMan

TRANSITION: Let's take a peek at PostMan

---

#### Automated API Integration - Writing the Test Suite

Build the API test collection with PostMan
<img class='stretch' src='img/itpro2020spring/PostMan.PNG'/>

???

- Link to learn PostMan at the end of the slide deck.
Recipe: 

- Experiment with a Swagger file (or curl) 
- Copy your successes into PostMan
- Refactor the PostMan suite into "Arrange, Act, Assert" pattern.

TRANSITION: What about web interfaces?

---

#### Authoring Automated Web Interface Integration Tests

- [Selenium with RoboFramework][12]
- [Selenium for RobotFramework][22]

Example `Test.robot` file:
```robot

Library   Dialogs    
Library   SeleniumLibrary  

*** Keywords ***

Fill In Form
  Input Text        mondayTimesheetHourValue    8   clear=false
  Input Text        tuesdayTimesheetHourValue    8   clear=false
  Input Text        wednesdayTimesheetHourValue    8   clear=false
  Input Text        thursdayTimesheetHourValue    8   clear=false
  Input Text        fridayTimesheetHourValue    8   clear=false
  Execute Manual Step   Please Confirm or Correct Values then press Pass
  Click Element    //input[@name="btnSubmit"]
  Page Should contain     You have successfully submitted your time
```

- Script is a bit longer than what you see here - to fit the slide.
- Needed an example that we could all relate to.
- Positive Time Reporting 
- I picked a tool that most of us can access
- and that we all want to make sure it is up and running.
- Link is in the slides - the goal here is to learn the tool.

TRANSITION: Example output

#### Automated Web Interface Integration Test Output

Test.robot example output:
```powershell
==============================================================================

1 test total, 1 passed, 0 failed
==============================================================================
Output:  C:\src\RobotFramework\output.xml

```

---

## Bonus Slide: Why not basic auth?

- Not terrific from a security perspective. Tends to carry a secret is good for a lot more than it needs to be good for.
- Tends to get stale - doesn't come with great ways to rotate the keys. You could bolt this on.
- Most importantly, the tech underneath is doesn't auto-update when security techniques move on.
- Doesn't carry additional information like claims.
- Doesn't integrate great with the tooling you might not know you want yet. i.e. API gateway integrations.

---

### Bonus Slide: When a cybersecurity geek reads "The Agile Manifesto":

- Individuals and interactions over ~~processes and tools~~ **automated cybersecurity scan emails**.

- Working **and secure** software over comprehensive documentation.

- Customer collaboration over ~~contract~~ **bug priority** negotiation.

- Responding to ~~change~~ **zero day patches** over following a plan.

***(This is tongue-in-cheek: I don't actually think the Agile Manifesto needed fixing.)***
