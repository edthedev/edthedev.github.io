## About the Teams

This team will help software development and operations teams across the University protect servers from cyber-threats and other disruptions. 
 
Keep an eye out for training events, open source recipes, scripts and playbooks from us in the future. Please also use us when you need a SecDevOps perspective toward solving a problem.

## Vision

- Doing Cybersecurity right makes automation harder - we're here to help with that.
- Automation meets needs faster if good enough cybersecurity is figured out in advance.
- Support the Technology Services Next Generation Infrastructure initiative.

TODO: 
- Pictures for each tool...
- Charts of how each tool connects...

## Q & A

---

## Bonus Slide: Why not basic auth?

- Not terrific from a security perspective. Tends to carry a secret is good for a lot more than it needs to be good for.
- Tends to get stale - doesn't come with great ways to rotate the keys. You could bolt this on.
- Most importantly, the tech underneath is doesn't auto-update when security techniques move on.
- Doesn't carry additional information like claims.
- Doesn't integrate great with the tooling you might not know you want yet. i.e. API gateway integrations.

---

## Bonus Slide: OAuth and JWT

## OLD SLIDES FOLLOW

---

### Why Change our Script Environment?

- The Goal: **Agile Cybersecurity Automation**. 
- The talent on this team merits a platform that can keep pace.

---

### Demo

- Get a DEV copy of settings.ini.
- Run the commands:

```powershell
choco install docker-desktop
choco install make
make build
make shell
```

- use `brew` instead of `choco` on Apple.
- use `apt-get` instead of `choco` on Linux.

---

### What's New?

- **GitHub Enterprise** provides a collaboration platform around Git that increases visibility into solutions and reduces time costs of developing solutions. 
- **Docker** is going to let us to each have a functioning development environment on our local laptop. This currently takes 4 commands.
- **Ansible**  is a good enough repeatable way to deploy Python code versioned in git to the server, and we've solved a similar need with it before within SDG. One or several pip packages is a possibility, but is not critical at this time.
- **Drone CI/CD** will be setup to automatically deliver code changes to production. 
- **Terraform** will be critical later when we start deploying to the cloud.

---

### On the Horizon

- Deliver Cybesecurity automation where we want it - i.e. Splunk. 
- The **Cybersecurity Team** will be asked to make changes using `git` and `pull requests`. 
- Adding a `pull request` does add a delay to the release cycle. The typical delay on my team has been **6 minutes**. You do *not* have to stop working while you wait. 

---

### Next Week

- **Cybersecurity Incident Responders** will, for now, continue to log into the production host to run the production scripts. 
- ***It will become possible to lose work if you make changes only on production.***
- The legacy DEV and TEST servers will eventually be less functional than the new Docker environments we are providing.
- Any `master` branch in GitHub that drives a deployment pipeline will be configured to reject direct changes. You will have to use a `pull request`. 

---

### What to do now? 

- Read `Pull Requests` that you see linked in the SecDevOps channel.
- Participate in discussion in the SecDevOps channel.
- Bring your scripting headaches to the SecDevOps channel.

---

### Take the Lead

- Give the Docker DEV environment a try.
- Read some Git resources. 
- Collaborate with SecDev to create your first `pull request`.

---


### Resources

- [Software Carpentry Git Traininig](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)
- Diagrams were created in [Archi - Open Format](https://www.archimatetool.com/download/). See `SecOps.archimate` file for diagram source. Image was done via Snipping tool.
