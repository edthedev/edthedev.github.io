# On Ensemble Programming

## About Edward

- 30 years programming
- 22 years programming professionally
- 11 years leading teams
- Small Business
- Super-Computers
- Education
- Finance
- Cybersecurity

???

- been a sole coder on a project, and have led a team of 11. Used pair and Ensemble proggramming for both. It's most important as a solo developer.

---

## When did I start?

Grade School
> Not enough computers

High School
> Overnight hacking on a big projector

College
> Find a group, or turn in late homework

???

- No fun. Fun. No fun, again.
- It gets fun again.

## Going Pro

Super-computing (Will's Idea)
> Daily ensemble, because I know Python, Will knows Super-computers

As the Boss (Michelle and John's Idea)
> Michelle and John daily ensemble to complete 4x the work with 0 bugs

In Finance (I finally get it.)
> Eleven developers in three cities meet daily for ensemble

COVID
> Daily ensemble from anywhere in the country

???

Super-Computing
- We accomplish things neither of us could have.
- But I still don't get it.
- 30,000 core computer, top 500 in the world.
- Same type and size of machine used to create the Jurrasic Park, Twister, Lost in Space
- I have no idea what I'm doing on an SGI

---

## Why Ensemble?

- no one knows everything
- learn by doing
- 4-6 times faster, conservatively
- dramatically lower bug rate
- learn by working closely with experts - after 30 years, I still find everyone knows something I don't.
- very few problems can withstand the power of 5 thoughtful experienced people working together for a day.
