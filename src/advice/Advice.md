## Do not touch the registry

I had to look up this gem to share it with someone again. Thanks to Microsoft’s ‘The Scripting Guys’ for summarizing the standard warning about touching the Windows registry:

“Warning: Don’t ever change a value in the registry. Ever. We know we just told you to do that, but would you jump off a cliff if we told you to? Don’t ever change a value in the registry. Don’t even say the word registry. We know a guy once who said the word registry, and three days later he was hit by a bus. True story. As a matter of fact, you shouldn’t even have a registry on your computer. If you suspect that you do have a registry on your computer, call us and a trained professional will be dispatched to your office to remove the registry immediately. If you accidentally touch the registry, wash your hands with soap and water and call a doctor. Do not swallow the registry or get it in your eyes!”

2019 March Update: I had the pleasure of meeting Ed Wilson at PowerShell Summit 2015, shortly before he and The Scripting Wife retired. He were delightful in person too!

## The Nth Penguin
2009 Nov. 30

Idiom: The early bird gets the worm.
Meaning: Many opportunities are just waiting for the first person to come along and claim them.
Idiom: The first penguin is the one that gets eaten.
Meaning: Be careful; sometimes there’s a reason everyone else is waiting.
Idiom: The last penguin doesn’t get any shrimp.
Meaning: If you’re too careful, you’re going to miss out on the thing you wanted.
Idiom: Be the second penguin.
Meaning: For a good opportunity, find someone who did it wrong and improve on their method.
Idiom: Be the (n+1)th penguin, where n is the predicted number of seals.
Meaning: Even the second penguin can get eaten.
Idiom: Be the ((prob.nearby * prob.hungry * num.seals)+1)th penguin.
Meaning: Math can be handy, but only if you do it quickly enough that you haven’t already missed all of the shrimp and quite a bit of the tobogganing and other penguin shenanigans.

## Is some smoke okay?
2009 Nov 22

My brother and I were discussing how sometimes someone asks for your help diagnosing their computer / iPhone / digital clock problem, and you ask them if anything strange happened lately, and they say no. You take it apart and have a look inside, and see burned out capacitors. So you ask “Did this let off smoke recently?” and they say “Yes.”

There are people who do not know which devices they own should and should not give off smoke. So as a public service, I’m writing a guide: Is some smoke okay?

Is giving off some smoke okay?

```
DEVICE NAME	IS SOME SMOKE OKAY?
Desktop computer	Not okay.
Laptop computer	Not okay.
Lamp	Not okay.
Power cord	Not okay.
Charcoal Grill	Okay.
Cellular phone	Not okay.
Candle	Okay.
VHS Tape	Not okay.
Television set	Not okay.
Cooking pot or pan	Okay.
Booklight	Not okay.
Printer	Not okay.
Microwave popcorn	Usually okay.
Cigarette	Okay.
Toaster	Okay.
Well done steak	Okay.
Electric blanket	Not okay.
Camp fire	Okay.
Gas or electric grill	Okay.
Pen light	Not okay.
Automobile	Okay.
Speakers	Not okay.
```

Tune in next week for ongoing segments, including “Is it okay if it’s really really hot?” and “Can I safely submerge it in water?”

Hemipiphany
The moment when one discovers either the root of the problem or the solution to it, but not both.

2019 March Update: This word was gifted to me by my colleague Nick Haggin, in response to my asking him for a word that fit the definition above.
I later gave him the prototype Big Red Button as a thank you. It felt like exactly the right kind of thank-you gift in return for such a useful word.
