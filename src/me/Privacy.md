## Privacy

There is a lot more talk than action around privacy today. As a community, we need to have an open detailed discussion of what privacy standards we expect from in our governments, businesses and our communities.

I think the [OWASP Top Ten Privacy Risks](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Top_10_Privacy_Risks_Project) is a good start.
