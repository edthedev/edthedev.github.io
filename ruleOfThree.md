# Ed's Rules, by Number

I say these things a lot. Now I can send you a link to them. It makes it official...that I say them a lot.

## Ed's First Rule of Three

Don't rush to find a generic solution.

- *One:* The first time you do something, do it the simplest way that will work. Think of the many future possibilities you could account for in your solution. Implement none of them.
- *Two:* The second time you do something, use the same solution that worked last time. Change only what you absolutely must. Think of the many future possibilities you could account for in your solution. Implement none of them.
- *Three:* The third time you do something, use the same solution that worked last time. Change what you must, in order for this solution to replace the previous two. Think of the many future possibilities you could account for in your solution. Implement the one or two that you are pretty sure you're going to need.

## Ed's First Rule of TWo

Two shall be the minimum number of collaborators on any effort. 

- Any effort unimportant enough to assign to a single team member is also unimportant enough not to do at all.
- Any effort worth assigning one person to is worth assigning a mentor and an understudy to.
- If at least two people don't know a system, turn it off.
- If you can't turn it off, assign a second person to learn it.
