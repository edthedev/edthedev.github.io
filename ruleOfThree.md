# Ed's First Rule of Three

Don't rush to find a generic solution.

- *One:* The first time you do something, do it the simplest way that will work. Think of the many future possibilities you could account for in your solution. Implement none of them.
- *Two:* The second time you do something, use the same solution that worked last time. Change only what you absolutely must. Think of the many future possibilities you could account for in your solution. Implement none of them.
- *Three:* The third time you do something, use the same solution that worked last time. Change what you must, in order for this solution to replace the previous two. Think of the many future possibilities you could account for in your solution. Implement the one or two that you are pretty sure you're going to need.
