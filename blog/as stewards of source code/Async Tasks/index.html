<p>It's hard.</p>
<p>Just add Async to the method name and assume total failure of you fine m don't get a nearly instant success response.</p>
<p>By the time anyone notices, it won't be your problem anymore.</p>
<p>Doing Async right is really difficult.
Doing Async close enough to right that no one noticed the problems most of the time is pretty easy.</p>
<p>TODO: have two separate chapters on Async programming, with identical chapter names, but many chapters apart on the book. Ideally the second more useful version comes <em>much</em> later in the book. Or even in an appendix.</p>
