<p>Stop thinking of your development team as being here to deliver code. Code sucks. Code is expensive to build and even more expertise to maintain, and tragically exoensibe to remove once it's past it's &quot;best used by&quot; date.</p>
<p>Your development team's job is to deeply understand your business domain. Also they should know how to code, as a distant secondary priority.</p>
<p>The first 90s of the problem is building the right solution correctly and in time for it to make she difference. The second 90 percent of the problem is deploying it without interrupting critical business activity, while it's still useful.</p>
<p>19 out of 20 software development protects are total failures.
But this doesn't mean you need to plan to fall 19 times for every success. If you've failed 19 times, you'll fall a 20th time.</p>

<p>The difference is deep understanding of the business domain by the development team. (Not just the buainess analyst team, it the usability specialist, or the manager who got promoted from the sales team...) In fact, on that 1 in 20 successful team, everyone anywhere near DevOps routinely takes the time to deeply understand the problems facing the organization.</p>
<p>Would you like to know the quick, guaranteed and painless way to become subject matter experts in the domains that challenge your organization?  There's exactly as many safe effective guaranteed shortcuts to deep expertise as there are to monetary wealth. So keep reading my books, and if you're feeling lucky, buy a bunch of lottery tickets.</p>
<p>Use the term Enabler.</p>
<p>All technical debt paid is an enabler.</p>
<p>Don't Force a track shift between technical debt and enablers. They are the same thing.</p>
<p>Leaders get tired of paying endless technical debt. Good leaders can commitv to enablers that pay off forever.</p>
