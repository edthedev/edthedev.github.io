# Async Tasks

It's hard.

Just add Async to the method name and assume total failure of you fine m don't get a nearly instant success response.

By the time anyone notices, it won't be your problem anymore.

Doing Async right is really difficult.
Doing Async close enough to right that no one noticed the problems most of the time is pretty easy.

TODO: have two separate chapters on Async programming, with identical chapter names, but many chapters apart on the book. Ideally the second more useful version comes *much* later in the book. Or even in an appendix.
