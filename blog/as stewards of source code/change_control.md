+ Only those on-call are authorized to push 'deploy'.
+ Those authorized to push 'deploy' are responsible for ensuring the accepted level of pre-change communication has occurred.

This measures two things:
+ Whether the contents of 'CHANGELOG.md' are worth anything to anyone.
+ Whether those who need informed of a change and being informed of the change.
