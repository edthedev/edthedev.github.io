<p>Change control boiled down to it's most essential elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only those on-call are authorized to push 'deploy'.</li>
<li>Those authorized to push 'deploy' are responsible for ensuring the accepted level of pre-change communication has occurred.</li>
</ul>
<p>A sign of success is when the contents of 'CHANGELOG.md' are routinely copy/pasted into various communication channels <strong>before</strong> the change is deployed into production, and a variety of stakeholders are indirectly providing feedback on the contents of CHANGELOG.md.</p>
<p>This measures two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether the contents of 'CHANGELOG.md' are worth anything to anyone.</li>
<li>Whether those who need informed of a change and being informed of the change.</li>
</ul>
