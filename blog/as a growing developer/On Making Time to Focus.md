# On Making Time to Focus

I don't accept push notifications for email under any circumstance - not phone, not at my desk.

I check my email four times daily on work days. Once at 7 am, once at 10 am, again at 2pm and then one final time at 5 pm.

The only times I respond to email are at 10 and 2. 

If an email chain is of strategic importance, I respond thoughtfully at 10 am. (A high energy time of day, for me.)

If an email required a response for some operational reason, I flag it and respond to every flagged email in a big batch at 2pm, but only on days when I don't have a meeting at 2pm.

When someone asks me "if I saw that email yet" I use this carefully considered pre-planned reply.

"No, I have not. What's up?"
