<p>I don't accept push notifications for email under any circumstance - not phone, not at my desk.</p>
<p>I check my email four times daily on work days. Once at 7 am, once at 10 am, again at 2pm and then one final time at 5 pm.</p>
<p>The only times I respond to email are at 10 and 2.</p>
<p>If an email chain is of strategic importance, I respond thoughtfully at 10 am. (A high energy time of day, for me.)</p>
<p>If an email required a response for some operational reason, I flag it and respond to every flagged email in a big batch at 2pm, but only on days when I don't have a meeting at 2pm.</p>
<p>When someone asks me &quot;if I saw that email yet&quot; I use this carefully considered pre-planned reply.</p>
<p>&quot;No, I have not. What's up?&quot;</p>
