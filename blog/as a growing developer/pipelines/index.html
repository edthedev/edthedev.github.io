<p>CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment â€“ a tool for delivering updates to software products with high frequency and low friction.</p>
<p>A CI/CD pipeline is like running water - as long as it keeps moving, flaws and
vulnerabilities can fall out like dirt or sand in a running stream.
Problems don't get the same chance to grow as in a stale rarely updated product.</p>
<p>We saw this recently with some of our own library dependencies.</p>
<ul>
<li>GitHub Dependabot identified a chain of dependencies that included vulnerable libraries.</li>
<li>Modernization of our solution continued as a monthly habit - made frictionless by our pipeline.</li>
<li>Routine processes resulted in updated dependencies and a rebuilt installation every 2 weeks.</li>
<li>The vulnerable libraries fell out of use in development use, then test use and then out of production use.</li>
</ul>
