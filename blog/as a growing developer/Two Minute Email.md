# Two Minute Email

+ I haven't taken now than 3 minutes to compose an email in several years as of 2021.

If it's going to take 10 minutes to compose an email, then I don't understand the situation well enough to trust to email.

Instead, I spend 2 minutes sending one key person a meeting invite.

If they add anyone else to the invite, I make a point of being warm and welcoming to that attendee. It's quite efficient to let others self select their meeting attendance - and it'll only happen if people know you support it.

The irony is, they feel that I've given them the white glove personal service. When my real motive was not wasting anyone's time.
