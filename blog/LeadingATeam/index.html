<p>These are some principles that apply to any team I run.</p>
<ul>
<li>We take care of ourselves, our teammates and then our stakeholders - in that order.</li>
<li>We value trust over process, but we understand that process builds trust.</li>
<li>We maintain a roadmap, which we update as needed. It answers 'why' as well as 'what' we intend to do.</li>
<li>Our schedules include time for: slack time (for responsiveness), recovery time (for the unexpected), and time for reflection (for growth and investment).</li>
<li>We strive to do things the lazy, proud and impatient way whenever possible <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?LazinessImpatienceHubris">see Laziness Impatience Hubris</a> or <a href="http://threevirtues.com/">Three Virtues</a>. But we get the job done with humility, patience, and hard-work, when needed.</li>
<li>No one is as smart toward the end of the work day as they wish they were. We go home and try again tomorrow.</li>
<li>When we can't go home and try tomorrow, then we invite trusted colleagues to look over our shoulder, to help catch the extra mistakes due to fatigue.</li>
</ul>

<a class="anchor" href="#committments-to-my-team" aria-labelledby="committments-to-my-team"><span hidden>#</span></a></div>
<p>These are some committments I make to any team I run.</p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone gets a primary and a secondary assignment at all times. These may change at any moment, but I will consistently communicate which is which.</li>
<li>I understand that time must pass between making something a primary assignment, and seeing meanginful progress on that assignment.</li>
<li>No assignment gets assigned to less than 2 people. This builds in cross training and resilience to sick days. If an assignment is not important enough for 2 people to work on, then it is not important enough for 1 person to work on.</li>
<li>Work with less than 1 lead assigned is, by definition, secondary priority (not primary). If it was primary, we would find a way to assign a lead. This also means that everyone's primary priority is aligned with a team lead's priorities.</li>
<li>I will identity a single person to act as owner for each software product. It will typically be the person who suffers the most when the product is wrong.</li>
</ul>
