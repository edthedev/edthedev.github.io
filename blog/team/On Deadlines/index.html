<p>Set a meaningful deadline and compress all the work to fit - by doing only the work that really really matters.</p>
<p>Blah blah blah - project plans bed deadlines. Dates matter.</p>
<p>Work up against a deadline is remarkably compressible.</p>
<p>To meet the deadline, simply deliver less. Drastically less. As much less as is needed to meet the deadline without working any nights or weekends.</p>
<p>(Working nights and weekends is creating more work for your future self. Only a good idea if you can be assured you will be paid overtime for it.)</p>
<p>Learn to promise less.
Learn to make promises that accurately describe both your best intentions and your worst case scenario fall back plan.</p>
<p>If there's a date attached, don't promise any with that isn't either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Already done, tested and demonstrated. Or</li>
<li>You could reasonably slap together in two hours, without skipping your coffee break.</li>
</ul>
<p>Compress your deadlines to fit.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do less work.</li>
<li>Do lower quality work.</li>
<li>Deliver the key value on time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Make a plan with your team in as much detail as they need to get comfortable. Throw away your copy of the plan as soon as the team takes ownership.</p>
<p>A lot of time owed to Adam Savage.  Throw away your copy owed to Mike Kramer.</p>
<p>Mike reserved the right to ask difficult questions about the new master plan to keep it on course.</p>
<p>Random additional thought: Ignore other people's fake deadlines. Find real meaningful ones and focus on them.</p>
