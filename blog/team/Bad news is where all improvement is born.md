# Bad news is where all improvement is born.

Welcome it to yourself with a smile. You want a valuable resource like bad news to come to you first. 

Deliver it to your effective leaders with a smile and a set of options to move forward (and with a budget request, where appropriate.)

But, like fertilizer, don't settle for less than the real thing. Fake bad news can't nurture grow any real change. Do don't manufacture bad news. Just collect it and apply it where it's needed.

...

Learn to create awkward silences. No one is going to interrupt the boss to give them bad news.
