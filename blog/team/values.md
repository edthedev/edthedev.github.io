## Principles of Agility in Cybersecurity

We often meet teams for the first time on their worst day.

Because of this we must build as safe a space as possible.

This may be a bad day. Experience teaches us another bad day is coming.

Our resources are finite, but our kindnesses can be expansive.

## What we strive to be

- Expert, but humble.
- Empathetic but resolute.
- Kind throughout.

## How we strive to behave

- We listen and we advise - both are kindnesses.
- We research, and we recommend. We teach and mentor. These are kindnesses.
- At our best we deliver underserved kindnesses.
- At minimum, we meet our commitments unrushed, with empathy.
- We work to make space for solutions to be found.
- We provide guidance to close gaps in process and tech.

## Our Measure of Success is Collaboration

Because we have limited resources, we measure success by counting the times
 leaders of meaningful teams reach out to us for collaboration.

We don't try to measure their success. We work to ensure it, and and we trust
 that we succeeded. If we're not aiding their success, our numbers will reflect
 this when they will stop asking us to collaborate.
