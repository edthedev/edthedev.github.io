<p>The correct response to &quot;just deploy it&quot; is &quot;it works on my machine. Good luck.&quot;</p>
<p>Deployment isn't simple. It isn't cheap. It is worth paying for.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Deliver garbage, rather than nothing at all. Celebrate delivering garbage. Be willing to build a team brand around delivering better shit until The turd is so shiny you can see your reflection in it.</p>
<p>All worthwhile work can shrink to fit the deadline without skimping on lunch hour.</p>
<p>There will always be another crisis.</p>
<p>There is always something that can be delivred that moves the needle.</p>
<p>There's urgent work and important work. Recognizing the difference isn't enough. You have to be ruthless in finding ways to compress the urgent work into less and less time. You might think this is a matter of automation - it can be. But it's mostly a matter of self discipline. Do the bare minimum, and then recognize that it's done, and stop. Then brag shamelessly to all who talk it listen about how it's done and the crisis is averted, and sing then the &quot;You're welcome&quot; song from Moana every time they ask about the non-urgent unimportant stuff you didn't do.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>There's nothing natural about deployment. Software does not naturally run anywhere but the computer where it was first developed.</p>
<p>The fact that deployments work on the first try even some of the time is a modern miracle of engineering.</p>
<p>If you expect deployment to be smooth and consistent without a lot of hard work, you're gonna have a bad time.</p>
