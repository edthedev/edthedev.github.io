## Too Silly for the Big Screen

Some characters and concepts are simply too silly to portray with comic book accuracy on a theater screen during a blockbuster movie.
Honorary mention will be given (frequently in the case of DC) for silly characters and concepts that made it into television or streaming broadcast; but those characters and concepts remain too silly for the movies, according to the rules of this list.

## Key

Various entries below are marked by their status as of the last update to this list.
The humor in this list was originally supposed to be - here's the 7 silly things they didn't include for every one they did.
It has evolved over time into 'Wow. They did all that at the movies. Okay. Wow.'

- ✓ Oh my goodness, they actually did this - on the big screen, in theaters!
- → Partial credit for a live action television or streaming appearance.
- x Assumed confirmed as too silly. Not only have they not done this, the moment this would have happened in the current movies has passed by.
- x✓ The moment passed, and they did it later anyway.

## The Founding Avengers

Marvel kicked this whole mess off by doing a fantastic job portraying Iron Man, one of their founding Avengers, on the silver screen, in a near-perfect rendition.

This should not work because Iron Man is an incredibly fun character, but kind of a lousy person - and there's no comic book Iron Man story I am aware of that doesn't somehow rely on his pretty significant character flaws. Iron Man is not too silly for the movies. 

They did excellent movies for The Hulk and Captain America around the same time. Die-hard comic fans may be aware that at this moment in around 2008, most of the original cast of the Avengers comic now had dedicated movies.  

Captain America gets the first checkmark on this list. It's so silly, they saved it for an after-credits scene:

- ✓ Captain Ameria was frozen for decades to allow him to have an origin in the 1940s but be an Avenger today. But he's fine. It was just cold.

With Captain America, Hulk and Iron Man at the movies, this left two more founding Avengers characters begging to get feature films: Thor and Namor.

This introduced this problem, and created the need for this list.  Thor and Namor are too silly for the big screen.
Thor and Namor are too silly to hide their silliness after the end credits.

- ✓ Thor is a viking from space who swings his hammer so fast that it picks up frost giants with the wind force.
- ✓ Namor is an Atlantean who always wears a speedo, is almost always angry, and flies through the sky on tiny wings attached to his ankles.

Besides their core premise, these core Avengers have silly friends and silly aspects that help define them:

- ✓ Thor flies by throwing his hammer and not letting go.
- ✓ Namor flies by flapping tiny wings on his ankles.
- ✓ If Thor lets go of his magic hammer for too long, he loses his fantastic powers.
- ✓ Thor is a founding member of the Avengers.
- x Namor is a founding member of the Avengers.

## The Other Avengers

So...the Avengers formula calls, critically, for lots more characters that you also cannot do in the movies.

- ✓ The Ant Man
- ✓ The Falcon - whose intense military training allows him to - put on some wings and flap about to defeat bad guys.
- ✓ Quicksilver is a mutant with super speed powers so powerful that he typically handles half of the foes in every battle he participates in. Quicksilver doing half of all the heroics makes a great comic book cover, but is probably untouchable for the movies.
- ✓ Hawkeye has a bow and arrow, which he is quite skilled with. That's it. That's his whole deal.
- Sentinel is an iconic Superman like character whose only weakness is his muderous split persona that kills exactly as many people as he saves in his Sentinel persona.
- Wonder Man is bascially Johny Cage from Mortal Kombat but with vaguely defined super powers.

And these characters have their own silly aspects:

- ✓ After a significant delay, Ant Man notices that 'Giant Man' seems like a much better way to handle super hero fights.
- ✓ After realizing 'Giant Man' is the more practical approach to fighting crime, 'Ant Man' goes back to being 'Ant Man'.
- ✓ The Falcon - our flappy bird hero - is the one guy that Captain America looks up to. Joking aside, I cannot empahsize enough how foundational this relationship is to telling a good Captain America story. I cannot express how screwed Marvel is that they have to include flappy bird man in the movies if they want to strongly portray their most iconic character, Captian America. (Unbelievably, Anthony Mackie's portrayal is both perfect and somehow makes the wings cool. They were not this cool in the comic.)
- Hawkeye - the man whose powers are a bow and arrow - leads the Avengers on various occassions.
- x Hawkeye - the man whose powers are a bow and arrow - and Quicksilver - the man who is too powerful to make good movies about - sometimes argue about who should lead the Avengers.


## More Silly Characters

- [Fancy Dan](https://villains.fandom.com/wiki/Fancy_Dan) who threatens Spider-Man with his sharp fashion sense and peak human dance moves.
- ✓ Spider-Ham - a normal spider was bit by a radioactive pig.
- ✓ Rocket Racoon
- ✓ Howard the Duck (how is he the first Marvel movie?!)
- ✓ Cosmo, the space dog. He and Rocket don't get along.
- ✓ Daredevil - a blind lawyer who swings around the city at night fighting crime.
- Squirrell Girl - her powers are roughly those of a Squirrell.
- Beta Ray Bill - Thor, but with a horse's head. (His face made a cameo, but I'm not checking this off until we see him lift the hammer and prove he is worthy.)
- ✓ Doctor Strange - egotistical surgeon turned wizard
- ✓ The Dread Dormamu - cosmic interdimensional villain with a face made of burning striped carpet
- ✓ Frog Thor
- Cat Thor - the star of Squirrell Girl's roommates fan fiction.
- → Luke Cage is the Power Man. His powers are stregth and nearly total invincibility. His weaknesses are everyone around him. His story is fantatsic, but his powers and costume are dumb.
- Diamondback - She throws diamonds. The diamonds she throws, with her hands, can hurt Luke Cage.
- → The Swordsman - His powers are charm and a sword. He's a bad-guy, but he's not a bad guy. 
- → The Porcupine - His powers are a suit covered in quills. He's scared to take it off. It's gross and sad.
- ✓ The Spot - with powers of poking holes in reality to punch Spider-Man through.
- The Wall - with powers of - bascially just being a brick wall.
- ✓ Paper Bag Man - because Spider-Man doesn't bring his costume grocery shopping and crime never rests.
- Agent Venom: Space Cop
- Citizen V
- Mach V - successor to Mach IV - successor to Mach III - successor to Mach II - successor to Mach I.
- The Fixer - stereotype evil scients minion army producing side-kick.

- Spider-Killer - robot commissioned by J.Jonah Jameson to kill Spider-Man.
- Sin Eater - Villain with a magic shotgun shoots people - cleansing them of all their sins.
- ✓ Task Master - A cheesy villain in skull mask copies the worst Avenger's abilities - bow and arrow, shield throwing, kicking and punching. Beloved fan favorite, believe it or not.
- ✓ Deadpool is brain-damaged and his brain-damage expresses itself by making him aware (through the 4th wall) that he is a character in media. While he is aware that this is an aspect of his brain damage and tries to ignore it, he is also always correct about the media format. 
- Jeffrey the Land Shark
- Stilt Man - who has (evil, I guess) robo-stilts.
- ✓ Spider Man 2099 is the most 90s thing to happen in the 1990s, but is from 2099.
- ✓ Shang Chi - whose powers are being great at Kung Fu.
- ✓ Iron First - Like Shang Chi, but only uses one limb to attack.
- Mister X - shows up without a shirt and starts flawlessly defeating every hand-to-hand fighter in the world. Does so in cool 90s shades. Does not take any of the fights seriously.
- ✓ The Vulture - What if The Falcon were a bad guy. Wouldn't that be scary? - I maintain after the fact that this shouldn't work - even after it clearly did. Marvel cheated by casting Michael Keaton.)

- → The Songmeister (DC)
- → The Red Tornado is an android that spins fast to create whirlwinds.

- Hydra Villain Dr. Zola - A teletubby like cyborg villain with a small camera for a head. Plenty of setup on Zola but he hasn't appeared with his teletubby body yet.

- Later, Iron Man breaks bad and has to get in a knock-down drag-out fight with an AI backup of his younger more altrusistic self. The AI backup is the hero of the story. The ending of the battle is cut short by the literal end of the world, which neither Iron Man does anything to prevent.
- Iron Man's AI backup finds a young girl who built her own iron suit, and declares itself her mentor. She is not enthused, and the AI is arguably not very helpful.

- Spider Man 2099 has *all* the powers of a spider, including a venomous bite.
- Doom 2099 turns out to be a decent guy just trying to get by in 2099, because Doom (or a clone of Doom) without the resources to threaten the planet is a pretty solid friend, employer and occassional hero.
