## The Founding Avengers

Marvel kicked this whole mess off by doing a fantastic job portraying Iron Man, one of their foudning Avengers, on the silver screen, in a near-perfect rendition. This should not work because Iron Man is an incredibly fun character, but kind of a lousy person - and there's literally no Iron Man story that doesn't somehow rely on his pretty significant character flaws.

They did Hulk and Captain America around the same time.
That leaves two more Avengers begging to get feature films: Thor and Namor. 

Here's why that could never happen.

- ✓ Thor is a viking from space who swings his hammer so fast that it picks up frost giants with the wind force.
- ✓ Namor is an Atlantean who always wears a speedo and is almost always angry.

Besides their core premise, Thor and Namor have silly friends and other silly aspects:

- ✓ Thor flies by throwing his hammer and not letting go.
- ✓ Namor flies by flapping tiny wings on his ankles.
- ✓ If Thor lets go of his magic hammer for too long, he loses his fantastic powers.
- All of Thor's Friends are too silly for the movies, but especially Beta Ray Bill - who is an alien with a horse head who is worthy of the power of Thor.
- x Namor is a founding member of the Avengers.
- The man in a speedo with tiny flappy ankle wings is primarily defined by his righteous but damanging anger over humanity's abuses of the planet's ecologicaly. This becomes his defining characteristics, in spite of his flying around on tiny flappy ankle wings.

## The Other Avengers

So...the Avengers formula calls, critically, for lots more characters that you also cannot do in the movies.

- ✓ The Ant Man
- ✓ The Falcon - his intense military training allows him to - put on some wings and flap about to defeat the bad guys.
- ✓ Quicksilver is a mutant with super speed powers so powerful that he typically handles half of the foes in every battle he participates in. It makes a great comic book cover, but is probably untouchable for the movies.
- ✓ Hawkeye has a bow and arrow, which he is quite skilled with. That's it. That's his whole deal.
- Sentinel is an iconic Superman like character whose only weakness is his muderous split persona that kills exactly as many people as he saves in his Sentinel persona.
- Wonder Man is bascially Johny Cage from Mortal Kombat but with vaguely defined super powers.

And these characters have their own silly aspects:

- ✓ After a significant delay, Ant Man notices that 'Giant Man' seems like a much better way to handle super hero fights.
- ✓ The Falcon - our flappy bird hero - is the one guy that Captain America looks up to. Joking aside, I cannot empahsize enough how foundational this is to telling a good Captain America story, and how screwed Marvel is that they have to include flappy bird man in the movies if they want to get their most iconic character right. (Unbelievably, Anthony Mackie's portrayal is both perfect and makes the wings cool. They were not this cool in the comic.)
- Hawkeye - the man whose powers are a bow and arrow - leads the Avengers on various occassions.
- x Hawkeye - the man whose powers are a bow and arrow - and Quicksilver - the man who is too powerful to make good movies about - sometimes argue about who should lead the Avengers.


## More Silly Characters

- ✓ Rocket Racoon
- ✓ Howard the Duck (how is he the first Marvel movie?!)
- ✓ Cosmo, the space dog. He and Rocket don't get along.
- Squirrell Girl
- Beta Ray Bill - Thor, but with a horse's head. (His face made a cameo, but I'm not checking this off until we see him lift the hammer and prove he is worthy.)
- ✓ Frog Thor
- Cat Thor - the star of Squirrell Girl's roommates fan fiction.
- ✓ Daredevil the blind lawyers swings around the city at night fighting crime.
- ✓ Luke Cage is the Power Man. His powers are stregth and invincibility. His weaknesses are everyone around him.
- Diamondback - She throws diamonds. The diamonds she throws can hurt Luke Cage.
- ✓ The Swordsman - His powers are charm and a sword. He's a bad-guy, but he's not a bad guy. 
- ✓ The Porcupine - His powers are a suit covered in quills. He's scared to take it off. It's gross and sad.
- ✓ The Spot - with powers of poking holes in reality to punch Spider-Man through.
- The Wall - with powers of - bascially just being a brick wall.
- ✓ Paper Bag Man - because Spider-Man doesn't bring his costume grocery shopping and crime never rests.
- Agent Venom: Space Cop
- Citizen V
- Mach V - successor to Mach IV - successor to Mach III - successor to Mach II - successor to Mach I.
- The Fixer - stereotype evil scients minion army producing side-kick.
- Hydra Bob - He joined Hydra for the dental plan, and stayed because the 'captured by heroes' insurance pays pretty good.
- Spider-Killer - robot commissioned by J.Jonah Jameson to kill Spider-Man.
- Sin Eater - Villain with a magic shotgun shoots people - cleansing them of all their sins.
- ✓ Task Master - A cheesy villain in skull mask copies the worst Avenger's abilities - bow and arrow, shield throwing, kicking and punching. Beloved fan favorite, believe it or not.
- ✓ Deadpool is brain-damaged and his brain-damage expresses itself by making him aware (through the 4th wall) that he is a character in media. While he is aware that this is an aspect of his brain damage and tries to ignore it, he is also always correct about the media format. 
- Jeffrey the Land Shark
- Stilt Man has (evil, I guess) robo-stilts.
- ✓ Spider Man 2099 is the most 90s thing to happen in the 90s, but is from 2099.
- ✓ Shang Chi - whose powers are being great at Kung Fu.
- ✓ Iron First - Like Shang Chi, but only uses one limb to attack.
- Mister X - shows up without a shirt and starts flawlessly defeating every hand-to-hand fighter in the world. Does so in cool 90s shades. Does not take any of the fights seriously.
- ✓ The Vulture - What if The Falcon were a bad guy. Wouldn't that be scary? - I maintain after the fact that this shouldn't work - even after it clearly did. Marvel cheated by casting Michael Keaton.)

## Silly Moments

These characters come with their own silly moments.

- Thor telling Cat Thor - "I see that your head is slowly growing every moment."
- Cat Thor is one of Loki's personal self-images in his own pysche.
- Luke Cage has to fight a guy for the right to call himself "Power Man".
- ✓ Luke Cage's "Power Man" costume.
- Task Master truly understands their place in the pantheon of comic villainy - and does the job, gets paid, and moves on before the heroes mop up.
- Task Master is a pretty good mentor whether for a hero or a villain.

## Organzations

- ✓ The Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division

## Twists - Possible Spoilers

Here be spoilers for the comics - and maybe for the movies.

- The Porcupine saves Captain America's life and becomes an Avenger.
- Peter Parker's friend Ned becomes the Hobgoblin - a villain who glides around on a surpluss Green Goblin glider and uses magic and pumpkin bombs to terrorize New York.
- The Spot succumbs to his one weakness - getting punched back, through those same holes in reality.
- Various villains break good by getting shot by sin eater.
- ✓ A younger more innocent Loki hops around the time trying to prevent his own future evil.
- ✓✓ Wilson Fisk - whose powers are wealth, evil, careful planning, minions, and being a pretty big guy - fights hand-to-hand when all else fails - and wins every one-on-one fight he ever particpates in, with rare exceptions.
- Norman Osborne - recovering goblin mask wearing psychopath - is the real hero at the end of the Secret Invasion.

- Iron Man breaks bad and has to get in a knock-down drag-out fight with a younger more altrustic version of himself. The younger version wins and vows not to break bad later.
- Later, Iron Man breaks bad and has to get in a knock-down drag-out fight with an AI backup of his younger more altrusistic self. The AI backup is the hero of the story. The ending of the battle is cut short by the literal end of the world, which neither Iron Man does anything to prevent.
- Iron Man's AI backup finds a young girl who built her own iron suit, and declares itself her mentor. She is not enthused, and the AI is arguably not very helpful.

- Spider Man 2099's best friend is basically a slinky.
- Spider Man 2099 has *all* the powers of a spider, including a venomous bite.
- Doom 2099 turns out to be a decent guy just trying to get by in 2099, because Doom (or a clone of Doom) without the resources to threaten the planet is a pretty solid friend, employer and occassional hero.
- Dr. Doom, when he lacks the resources the threaten the planet is a pretty solid friend, employer and occassional hero.
- Dr. Doom is a good uncle who only wants the best for his niece.
- Dr. Doom's niece is almost certainly the most important person in any and all timelines, and occassionally relies on her despotic dictator uncle for sound life advice.

- Our version of Reed Richards has to deal with Namor (flappy wing feet) constantly trying to woo his wife away from their family.
- Our version of Reed Richard's homeschool with a some mole people, an evil super scientist's clone and a robot dragon.
- Our version of Reed Richards has to fight for custody in court over the evil super scientists clone.
- Our version of Reed Richards - the one who cannot even gather the infinity stones - was doing the important work all along raising his family, because his kids are way more powerful and critical to the timeline than the (infinity stone gathering)k Council of Reeds ever was.
- Task Master's secret handler is his forgotten wife and a current former S.H.E.I.L.D. agent.
- The Punisher becomes the Ghost Rider
