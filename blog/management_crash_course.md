## Make Slack

> Make Slack / Have a Single Team Priority / Brag to Enable Next Steps

Use 'pull' not push. To the greatest extent possible, let team members choose their work as long as it aligns with the team priority you have communicated. Unless they are still in training, they know their jobs. If they are still in training, assign a senior or lead member of your team to guide them through choosing their work.

For the team, choose one priority every day for the entire team. Only ever ask status questions related to today's priority. Never, under any circumstance, ask a question about something that is not the team's top priority today. Recruit and motivate people and the other work will still get done. When following this rule, there are some questions you will never ask. This is good because those questions were not important. Control your worry.

It is not possible to follow the advice in this book while worrying. Controling worries is a topic for an entire separate book. I highly recommend Dale Carnegie's "How to Stop Worrying", which is an excellently researched well edited masterpiece on the topic.


Diligently track team member victories, and never miss a chance to brag about them. Use one plain text file per year (for the whole team) with clean Markdown formatting. Have a real disaster recovery plan for this text file. Plan offsite backup and restore, and test it on this file. This `victories.md` file is critical to making time and space for your team to do great things.

Another way to make space for your team to do great work is to build relationships with colleagues. Invest early and your collegues will make space for your team to work when it matters. Again, this is a topic for an entire book. Dale Carnegie, once again, has proced a masterpiece on the topic "How to Win Friends and Influence people."

While I don't have a word to add on "How Not to Worry", I have a couple of tips to add on building relationships.

Write down people's exact words when taking notes. This makes them feel validated. Surprisingly few people do this, and people will notice and feel respected by you immediately. It's a simple trick build trust. Try it on your CEO, CIO, CISO or director sometime.

Tip number 2 is to keep track of the trust you have earned, and hold yourself accountable to it. Trust built is easily lost, and so we must stay vigilantly aware of those who trust us and whether we are unfailingly acting worthily of that trust.

Often this vigilant worthiness just takes the form of blunt honesty. I have many times told a colleague "What your team deserves from mine is X, but what we can deliver is Y. We will work to close this gap."
