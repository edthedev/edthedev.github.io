<ul>
<li>Tell me about a typical work day</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>look for signs of time gaps in what should have been  easy automatic processes. Every company has some. Are they ones you can live with?
Look for an admission that the team wastes some time together beacuse they actually like eachother
Look for awareness of the manager schedule and the creative schedule. If there's no mention of the creative schedule, don't bet on innovating.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Tell me about your disaster recovery plans.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>This answer directly scores the maturity of the organization.
This answer should determine how much savings you put aside against their company going abruptly out of business.
Do their disaster recovery plans include provisions to protect customers, staff, C suite leaders, shareholders, and the general public? Whichever of these is missing can be very insightful.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Tell me about your release schedule</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Look for signs of self respect.
Do they release at 4:55 pm on Friday before a holiday weekend?
Do they do tons of unreleased work?
The correct answer is Monday through Thursday excluding holidays, targeting biweekly to monthly, with typical 5 day notice.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Tell me about a time your team failed.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Look for evidence of psychological safety.
A team that can't handle failure will never achieve anything interesting.
Great teams say what changed after the failure in the same breath as talking about it.
Great leaders take responsibility for failure and use it to rally people to make improvements.
Look for evidence that the failure was widely communicated. Shitty teams cover up failures with lies.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>In what ways does your teams processes differ from standard agile practices?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We don't quite do full agile&quot; is the first sentence of the answer of any team that is really striving for agility.
What are they striving for next? How frustrated will you be if you work there and they never achieve it?
Do they do retrospectives every sprint? Teams without retrospectives aren't growing. They don't have to call it a retro, but it has to be happening. If it's not happening at the team level, then only certain (older white male long-tenured) staff are being consulted in the informal retros.</p>
