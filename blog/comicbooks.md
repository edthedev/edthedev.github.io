title: Too Dumb for Comic Book Movies
---

## The Founding Avengers

Marvel kicked this whole mess off by doing a fantastic job portraying Iron Man, one of their foudning Avengers, on the silver screen, in a near-perfect rendition. This should not work because Iron Man is an incredibly fun character, but kind of a lousy person - and there's literally no Iron Man story that doesn't somehow rely on his pretty significant character flaws.



- Thor
- All of Thor's Friends, especially Beta Ray Bill
- Namor (founding avenger who lives underwater, always wears a speedo and has little flappy ankle wings that let him fly) 
- The man in a speedo with tiny flappy ankle wings is primarily defined by his righteous but damanging anger over humanity's abuses of the planet's ecologicaly. This becomes his defining characteristics, in spite of his flying around on tiny flappy ankle wings.

## The Other Avengers

So...the Avengers formula calls, critically, for some characters that you can't do in the movies.

- ✓ The Ant Man
- ✓ After a significant delay, Ant Man notices that 'Giant Man' would have been another way to fight crime.
- ✓ Quicksilver is a mutant with super speed powers so powerful that he typically handles half of the foes in every battle he participates in. It makes a great comic book cover, but is probably untouchable for the movies.
- ✓ Hawkeye has a bow and arrow, which he is quite skilled with. That's it. That's his whole deal.
- Hawkeye - the man whose powers are a bow and arrow - leads the team on various occassions.
- Hawkeye - the man whose powers are a bow and arrow - and Quicksilver - the man who is too powerful to make good movies about - sometimes argue about who should lead the Avengers.
- Sentinel is an iconic Superman like character whose only weakness is his muderous split persona that kills exactly as many people as he saves in his Sentinel persona.
- ✓ The Falcon - his intense military training allows him to - put on some wings and flap about to defeat the bad guys.
- ✓ The Falcon - our flappy bird hero - is the one guy that Captain America looks up to. Joking aside, I cannot empahsize enough how foundational this is to telling a good Captain America story, and how screwed Marvel is that they have to include flappy bird man in the movies if they want to get their most iconic character right. (Unbelievably, Anthony Mackie's portrayal is both perfect and makes the wings cool. They were not this cool in the comic.)

## More Characters

- ✓ Rocket Racoon
- ✓ Howard the Duck (how is he the first Marvel movie?!)
- ✓ Cosmo, the space dog. He and Rocket don't get along.
- Squirrell Girl
- Beta Ray Bill - Thor, but with a horse's head. (His face made a cameo, but I'm not checking this off until we see him lift the hammer and prove he is worthy.)
- ✓ Frog Thor
- Cat Thor - the star of Squirrell Girl's roommates fan fiction.
- Thor telling Cat Thor - "I see that your head is slowly growing every moment."
- Cat Thor is one of Loki's personal self-images in his own pysche.
- ✓ Daredevil the blind lawyers swings around the city at night fighting crime.
- Luke Cage is the Power Man. His powers are stregth and invincibility. His weaknesses are everyone around him.
- Luke Cage has to fight a guy for the right to call himself "Power Man".
- ✓ Luke Cage's "Power Man" costume.
- Diamondback - She throws diamonds. The diamonds she throws can hurt Luke Cage.
- ✓ The Swordsman - His powers are charm and a sword. He's a bad-guy, but he's not a bad guy. 
- ✓ The Porcupine - His powers are a suit covered in quills. He's scared to take it off. It's gross and sad.
- The Porcupine saves Captain America's life and becomes an Avenger.
- Peter Parker's friend Ned becomes the Hobgoblin - a villain who glides around on a surpluss Green Goblin glider and uses magic and pumpkin bombs to terrorize New York.

## Stuff

- ✓ The Thanos Copter. It's a 1970s earth helicopter painted with bright yellow paint. It has the word 'Thanos' written on the side in purple letters.
- Thanos rides in the 'Thanos Copter' during his battle with Squirrell Girl
- The Comics Stone
- The Ego Stone

## Twists - Possible Spoilers

- ✓ A younger more innocent Loki hops around the time trying to prevent his own future evil.
- ✓✓ Wilson Fisk - whose powers are wealth, evil, careful planning, minions, and being a pretty big guy - fights hand-to-hand when all else fails - and wins every one-on-one fight he ever particpates in, with rare exceptions.
- Norman Osborne - recovering goblin mask wearing psychopath - is the real hero at the end of the Secret Invasion.

- Iron Man breaks bad and has to get in a knock-down drag-out fight with a younger more altrustic version of himself. The younger version wins and vows not to break bad later.
- Later, Iron Man breaks bad and has to get in a knock-down drag-out fight with an AI backup of his younger more altrusistic self. The AI backup is the hero of the story. The ending of the battle is cut short by the literal end of the world, which neither Iron Man does anything to prevent.
- Iron Man's AI backup finds a young girl who built her own iron suit, and declares itself her mentor. She is not enthused, and the AI is arguably not very helpful.

- ✓ Spider Man 2099 is the most 90s thing to happen in the 90s, but is from 2099.
- Spider Man 2099's best friend is basically a slinky.
- Spider Man 2099 has *all* the powers of a spider, including a venomous bite.
- Doom 2099 turns out to be a decent guy just trying to get by in 2099, because Doom (or a clone of Doom) without the resources to threaten the planet is a pretty solid friend, employer and occassional hero.
- Dr. Doom, when he lacks the resources the threaten the planet is a pretty solid friend, employer and occassional hero.
- Dr. Doom is a good uncle who only wants the best for his niece.
- Dr. Doom's niece is almost certainly the most important person in any and all timelines, and occassionally relies on her despotic dictator uncle for sound life advice.
- Reed Richards has trouble balancing his cross multiverse collaboration with his other selves with raising a family.
- Most versions of Reed Richards have collected the infinnity stones and are using them to terraform their reality for the betterment of all sentients.
- Our version of Reed Richards never got around to collecting the infinity stones because he has a family.
- Our version of Reed Richards has to deal with Namor (flappy wing feet) constantly trying to woo his wife away from their family.
- Our version of Reed Richard's homeschool with a some mole people, an evil super scientist's clone and a robot dragon.
- Our version of Reed Richards has to fight for custody in court over the evil super scientists clone.
- Our version of Reed Richards - the one who cannot even gather the infinity stones - was doing the important work all along raising his family, because his kids are way more powerful and critical to the timeline than the (infinity stone gathering)k Council of Reeds ever was.
