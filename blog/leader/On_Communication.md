## On Communicating as a Leader

Principles:

- Create a Safe Space
- Never assume you have been understood. You have not.
- Take care whenever you cannot read each audience member's face for feedback.
- Slow down.

Why do I have these principles? I developed some pretty thick skin, which can cause me to hurt others.
These rules help me cause less harm as I rampage along passionately through ideas I want to share.

## On Creating Safe Spaces for communication

Create a safe space. This could be a very bad day for your audience. Everyone is dealing with things they don't talk about.
At a bare minimum, the person you are talking to is probably dealing with some background anxiety, impostor syndrome and stage fright.

If you can be the safe voice that props them up before they get out on stage, you'll be their go-to when it matters.

## On Being Understood

You were not understood. Repeat the message over and over.
Never assume that it is widely understood. It *still* is not.

"The Wizard who has tired of checking their food for poisons, has tired of life itself."
Similarly, the professional who has tired of explaining fundamental concepts of
 their job - has tired of being paid to do that job.

How many times must you explain this concept?
"As always, Miss Swan, at least once more."

Be willing to say the same thing a few times in different ways. Speak to values and desired outcomes, not to specifics or details. Communicate up to 3 important points per half hour. Don't speak for more than a half hour.

## Speak as simply and clearly as possible to larger groups

Take care when speaking whenever you cannot read each audience member's face for feedback.

Public Speaking (styled for an uncertaun audience) should always be used for groups of four or more.
You can still maintain a down-to-earth public speaking persona, but it needs to be free of assumptions of being understood.
The ability in a smaller group to notice facial reactions at moments of misunderstanding is not available while speaking to larger groups. 
This situation requires caution.

Seeing everyone in the audience as an equal can lead to the mis-step of assuming they have identical understanding of the topic, identical experiences and identical assumptions to ones own. In these conditions, miscommunication is practically guarteed.

## Slow Down

People tend to speak faster when their heart is racing with nervousness or excitement.
It's excellent to embrace opportunities to speak when nervous or passionate, or ideally both.

But the principles discussed above cannot be practiced in a hurry.

The trivial mantra 'slow down' is the first starting point of adopting the principles above.
