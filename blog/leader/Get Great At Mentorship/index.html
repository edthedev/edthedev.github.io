<p>I'll probably have a lot in this chapter about why mentorship works.</p>
<p>But screw that. Do it because you owe it. You didn't figure this stuff
out on your own. You learned from others who paid it forward either in direct
Mentorship or books or online resources.</p>
<p>If you're not also willing to pay it forward, you're a parasite on the
community.</p>
<p>Too many developers ask &quot;what does code review do for me&quot;, and forget that
this community built their high paying prestigious job.</p>
<p>You're not too good to help the next generation get started. You might not be
good enough to help, but you can try.</p>
<p>Not sure how to mentor? Resolve to bring your mentee to any meeting you can
that is worth your time.</p>

<p>I'll not belabor this point, as there's plenty been written on the value and art of mentorship. Here's a quick primer in case you don't go pick up a better book on the topic.</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose your mentees with care</li>
<li>Spend time with your mentees</li>
<li>Listen to your mentees</li>
</ul>

<p>You don't have infinite time, and mentorship takes time.
Be intentional in who and how many people you choose as your mentees.
If you have more than five mentees,
you do them each a diservice by not focusing.</p>
<p>When choosing mentees, consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who is actively seeking your professional counsel?</li>
<li>Who do you owe a debt for building up your career? Who has done unpleasant work that contributed to your upcoming success?</li>
<li>Does your professional experience contain lessons that can improve their professional outcomes?</li>
<li>Who has potential to grow into a key player in your vision for the future of your team?</li>
<li>Is their life experience diverse enough from yours to create value in the contrast?</li>
</ul>

<a class="anchor" href="#spend-time-with-your-mentees" aria-labelledby="spend-time-with-your-mentees"><span hidden>#</span></a></div>
<p>The old proverb - &quot;How do you spell love?&quot;, &quot;T. I. M. E.&quot;
There's no substitute for time with your mentees.</p>
<p>As with many thing in agile, we default to two weeks, and setting aside half an hour.
Then we adjust as needed.</p>
<p>In the case of mentorship, that means 30 dedicated minutes, every other week, for each mentee.</p>
