# How I spend my work day
(As a free person)

I gave up on compartmentalizing my work day years ago.

My self-imposed number one responsibility during work hours is to be available to current and past colleagues.

My self imposed number two responsibility is to invest in my career - which means doing something that moves me toward:

+ retiring successfully
+ Greater job satisfaction
+ Greater job impact on the world

Most days, those motives and my assigned work love up exactly, because I've been doing this long enough that ice achieved a high alignment between my goals and my professional role.

But in days when it doesn't, I take care of the thing that matters to me and I don't apologize to anyone for doing so. Turns out no one actually minds.

How to get there:

Learn what the minimum to not get fired is. Do that minimum as a matter of routine. Then invest the rest of the time into self development.

No one even considers this selfish or lazy - it's above and beyond the minimum most others are doing - any time the self investment benefits the firm!

And any time the firm realizes it's preferential goals for you differ from your own, you look like a go-getter - the sort of person the firm might want to make allowances to keep around.
