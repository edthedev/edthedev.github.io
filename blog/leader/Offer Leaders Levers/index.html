<p>See which ones they pull.</p>
<p>Three big ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>Utility bill - it varies, but we pay it. Every time.</li>
<li>Strategy Investment - Every leader has a pet strategic project or three and often they change in relative priority. Be responsive as your leader moves these levers, but always show the costs of each move honestly. Be agile, but make sure the costs of each jump are understood. Remember that ever move of these levers creates bad news, which like great fertilizer can be used to invest for growth and change. Always capture this bad news and apply it where needed.</li>
<li>Wide Spread Investment - Leaders should invest more when able, and maybe not at all during a crisis. This kind of Investment is the rainy day fund. It's <strong>mostly</strong> in training and retaining your staff. Turning this lever down should be tolerated with empathy (while polishing your resume and moving at your convenience to somewhere that has the lever turned up.) Turning this lever up should be celebrated loudly, because the harvest will be excellent.</li>
</ul>
<p>Strategy Investment is really a bunch of different levers with valuable strategic outcomes. Leaders who can pick just one lever to crank to max will do well - BUT only if they learn not to touch the operational lever.</p>
<p>Only set the operational lever where your team tells you to, and never lower. No one loves doing this stuff. They're not making up the need. You might think you have special insights, but you don't. Natural selection allowed your firm to exist at this operational cost level. If you truly have to lower this lever, it should be as part of a plan to gracefully exit the market entirely and let everyone go to a organization suited to continue to exist. If you invest in the right strategic or enablers, they may pay off with less operational resource demand from your team. If that happens, is great! But don't count your chickens before they hatch. Only lower your operational investments when your team tells you to. Never sooner.</p>
<p>Strategic and enabler investments are lottery tickets with excellent average returns, but no guarantees. Don't ever bet the farm. Do always keep making good bets.</p>
<p>Enablers are &quot;boss, leave me alone&quot;. Leavw good people to their own devices and good things will happen. But don't do it all the time or you have no strategy. Mix it up. Drive hard toward a strategy and accomplish it as one big team. Then let up and activate every clean up, technical debt or foundational effort you can find for awhile. On the strategic stuff, keep a close watch on the critical path. On the enablers, just send around a call for recent victories every couple of weeks, and celebrate then widely.</p>
<p>Strategic goals are the big game. Enablers are the work out room and the sauna. Your teams need a rythmn of both.</p>
