<p>Spoiler: They are actually finishing their degree, or they have a kid going through a rough time, or a relative they care deeply for is dying slowly.</p>
<p>These things are temporary. Treat them with extra loyalty during these times - sadly often only a year or two - and you will have a loyal colleague for decades.</p>
<p>The odds are that today you simply can't hire the people I can hire because you missed the chance to invest in them when I invested in them.</p>
<p>Another possibility is they are truly a bad fit for your team. This is rare. It's much more likely that your team sucks at training and doesn't know how to do it's own work, than that your team found a human who can't learn their line of work.</p>
<p>As you work with your team members during one on one's to find their motivations and align work that serves your team to those, you may find a total mismatch. In that case, you need to mentor toward the likelihood they will leave your team once they grow toward their passion. You can still be a mentor while they find the right thing for them. Don't forget that they can still be an excellent ally to you someday after they find their best groove.</p>
