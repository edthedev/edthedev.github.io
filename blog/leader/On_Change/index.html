<p>I typically take two one on one meetings for any change in an individuals
responsibilities. First to discuss. Second for the team member to bring back
questions, comments, concerns.</p>
<p>I also commit to not changing team-wide processes except during my sprint
retrospective meetings.</p>
<p>Both of these are on a two week cycle, and I never miss them (always reschedule
if conflicted.)</p>
<p>In the retro, I require every team member to chime in on every change with a
vote of &quot;strong yes&quot;, &quot;meh&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. A change can be implemented with a
combination of &quot;strong yes&quot; and &quot;meh&quot;. But a single &quot;no&quot; means we take a step
back from the proposed change and re-evaluate, reword, and/or discuss the
outcome I am after in more detail. Sometimes a change waits a sprint and we
discuss again in two weeks.</p>
<p>Any change I need can probably wait a month, because the process results in
teams that work.</p>
<p>Sometimes the team convenes to suspend a recent change during a stand-up
meeting. When that happens, I declare the change out of use, and we discuss and
vote again (usually to never try that painful approach again) at next retro.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#discussing-changes" aria-labelledby="discussing-changes"><span hidden>#</span></a></div>
<p>Expert, but humble.</p>
<ul>
<li>Empathetic but resolute.</li>
<li>At minimum, we meet our commitments unrushed, with empathy.</li>
<li>We make space for solutions to be found.</li>
<li>We close gaps in process and tech.</li>
</ul>
<p>Kind throughout.</p>
<ul>
<li>We listen and we advise - both a kindness.</li>
<li>We research, and recommend. We teach and mentor. These are kindnesses.</li>
<li>At our best we deliver underserved kindnesses.</li>
</ul>
<p>When making recommendations for others, we make a conscious choice to speak from
our own experience, without projecting.
- The simplest step is to replace &quot;you should&quot; with &quot;we have needed to&quot;.</p>
<p>We bless the tech that got a team where it is today.</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid negative words - they worked hard on their piece-of-crap solution.</li>
<li>Encourage parallel deployment.</li>
<li>Don't aks them to give up a mature solution, ask them to enhance it.</li>
<li>Everyone's baby is ugly, but it's still their baby.</li>
</ul>
