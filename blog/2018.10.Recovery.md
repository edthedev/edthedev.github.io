## On the Enjoyment of Weekends

Having 2 kids under four sometimes boils the weekend down to essentials.

I like to create simple mantras to optimize (or simply better weather) my weekends.

My latest weekend mantra

'''
Rest, Recovery, Adventure
'''

### Rest

Rest is simple enough - sleep in, take a nap, spend an hour starting at a wall doing nothing. Eat butritious food. Make time for upliftibg media.
### Recovery

Taking time for recovery is less obvious to my sleep deprived brain, this my mantra to remind myaelf.

Recovery covers a lot, but at the core it's reneged spent nos to save energy later.
