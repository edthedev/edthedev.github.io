## On the Enjoyment of Weekends

Having 2 kids under four sometimes boils the weekend down to essentials.

I like to create simple mantras to optimize (or simply better weather) my weekends.

My latest weekend mantra

'''
Rest, Recovery, Adventure
'''

### Rest

Rest is simple enough - sleep in, take a nap, spend an hour starting at a wall doing nothing. Eat butritious food. Make time for uplifting media. Cuddling on the couch with one of the kids and a good book.


### Recovery

Taking time for recovery is less obvious to my sleep deprived brain, this my mantra to remind myaelf.

Recovery covers a lot, but at the core it's energy spent now to save energy later.

It includes the mundane: dishes, laundry, making my bed.

At it's best it includes: buying healthy groceries, getting an extra exercise set in, buying something that addresses some recurring pain point from the last month.

### Adventure

Some adventures are big, but I like to remember that some are small.

A walk in a garden, a multi-day trip to an exotic attraction, pancakes with good friends.
Doing a jigsaw puzzle, solving to an escape room, 

### Balance

Many of these things find me without any effort.
My wife and I schedule adventures.
The dishes and laundry and children call out for my attention.

The mantra helps me intentionally make time for whichever category is being missed this weekend.
