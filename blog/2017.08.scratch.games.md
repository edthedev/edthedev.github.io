# Scratch Games

## Learn to Code

The following games were written with the goal of being fun to play in as few lines as possible.
Full tutorials for how to make each game are available online at [Scratch.Delaporte.us](http://scratch.delaporte.us).

I occassionally teach a community Learn to Code class at the local library, where elementary school aged kids can learn to write these games.

## Peanut Butter Panic

I have played a surprising number of hours of 
[Peanut Butter Panic!]() in my life. It is fun.

I was surprised to learn that this game was written by [a division of the Children's Television Workshop](). So this game is another great thing that happened because of the folks who made Seasame Street. And equally importantly, it means the Nutkins count as Muppets, and are therefore my favorite muppets. "You've probably never heard of them."

Anyway, this silly little game has always been more fun that it has any right to be, so I hope you enjoy  my [semi-faithful remake of Peanut Butter Panic! in Scratch]().

## Duck, Duck, Goose!

I wrote [Duck, Duck, Goose!]() in about 20 minutes, based on an idea my son had. It's probably too many lines of code to fit into the tutorial format above, though.

## Hungry Bug

[Hungry Bug](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/170625346/) was an early attempt I made at writing something fun to play made from minimal code. The games in the tutorial section above are much better.

## Cat in a Cup!

While writing [Cat in a Cup!](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/170575212/) I discovered how surprisingly easy it is to write advanced animated interactions in Scratch. It's a simple implementation of [Shell Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_game). 
The finished product still has too many lines of code to be included in the tutorial section above.

But while writing this game I realized that total lines of code can be reduced a lot by offloading decisions to the player. I used that principle in each of the games that did make it into the tutorials.

## Planting Wizard

[Planting Wizard]() is a remix my wife made or a remix I made of some code I found on [Algorithm Ink](http://azarask.in/projects/algorithm-ink/#99fdc2df) and [another Scratch project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/170627495/) and later ported into Scratch. I like my wife's version better than [mine]().
