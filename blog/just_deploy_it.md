# Just Deploy It

The correct response to "just deploy it" is "it works on my machine. Good luck."

Deployment isn't simple. It isn't cheap. It is worth paying for.

Deliver garbage, rather than nothing at all. Celebrate delivering garbage. Be willing to build a team brand around delivering better shit until The turd is so shiny you can see your reflection in it.

All worthwhile work can shrink to fit the deadline without skimping on lunch hour.

There will always be another crisis.

There is always something that can be delivred that moves the needle.
