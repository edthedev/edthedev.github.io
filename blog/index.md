>Coming soon (whenever) - my honest thoughts on programming, but mostly about
>mentorship among programmers.

For as long as I can remember, the world has had too few computer programmers,
and we have been predicting that the next bumper crop of programmers-in-college
would address it.

The world's colleges are now graduating an excellent, but still insufficient,
number of programmers. More graduates did not solve the problem.

I believe this is because the attrition rate among new programmers is still very
high. Programming is an incredibly frustrating profession to learn.

To put it more strongly - the trade of computer programming is only hanging on
by the force of effective mentorship.

The shortage in master programmers can actually be measured, using the [Common
Vulnerability Enumberation trends over time][1].

We should try to maximize the effects of what mentorship we have. If that
resonates with you, you may get value from these articles.
