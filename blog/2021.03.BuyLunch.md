# Buy Lunch

I previously worked at a company that, as a matter of policy, paid for lunch for new employees but not for departing employees. 

It's hard to express how incredibly short-sighted I find this. Naturally, I ignored this rule and paid for lunch for my departing employees out of my own pocket.

A typical person's career is four or five decades long. It's not uncommon for an organization to exist for an equally long time. While I love good food, there's only so much one can spend on a single lunch - even when really trying.

It's such a cheap and easy way to close a chapter in a professional relationship on a positive note. It boggles my mind that any (private non-regulated) organization (that has the freedom to buy a lunch for new hires) would have a policy specifically against it.
