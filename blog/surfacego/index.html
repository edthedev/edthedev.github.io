  <h1> Linux on my Surface Go </h1>

  <div class="heading-wrapper h2">
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>I chose Ubuntu because I want to play Steam games.</p>
<p>I have really wanted to install Linux on the Surface Go from the day I bought it, but I did not feel confident that the drivers and work-arounds would be available, until today.</p>
<p>I bought the Surface Go for the delightful hardware design, not for the operating system that ships with it. I find Windows 10 to be perfectly tolerable. I used Windows 10 on my Surface Go for about six years.</p>
<p>My biggest motive for staying with Windows was Steam games, and my biggest motive for swithing is - Steam games.</p>
<p>Over the years I have owned a Surface Go, my Windows install has gotten slower, while my Steam game library compatibility with Linux has gotten stronger.</p>
<p>I recently realized I was not choosing to play any games at all, and I was frustrated by lag during text editing and web browsing. So it was time to make the switch!</p>
<p>My notes follow. This is meant to be an overview, not a perfect guide. There are better step-by-step guides out there already. Read this if you're trying to get a sense of how much work the change will be, and how it went for me.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>I used Pendrive Linux to create a bootable USB stick with Ubuntu 20.04.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I looked up my BitLocker Encryption key in my personal Microsoft account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I disabled BitLocker encryption in Windows, because I didn't want to type in my BitLocker key after every reboot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I did a bunch of bios/UEFI dancing (hold Volume-Down during boot) to (temporarily) disable secure boot, and to bump USB up in the boot order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I backed up my OEM Windows 10 key, in case I want to restore Windows.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip: Don't be like me, apply the latest firmware updates through Windows before you start.
I may end up re-installing Windows in dual boot, just to apply some firmware updates.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<a class="anchor" href="#installation" aria-labelledby="installation"><span hidden>#</span></a></div>
<p>I booted to the PenDrive Linux, chose Ubuntu, and <code>Install Ubuntu</code>. I selected <code>Minimal Install</code>, because I am <em>very</em> familiar with available Linux applications, and I am quite picky about which ones I will add later.</p>
<div class="heading-wrapper h2">
<h2 id="fixes">Fixes</h2>
<a class="anchor" href="#fixes" aria-labelledby="fixes"><span hidden>#</span></a></div>
<p>I knew before I started that this was going to take some work to get working just right, because the Surface Go is a unique piece of hardware. The unique hardware is why I bought it!</p>
<p>My dream is to someday own a fully open and repairable equivalent computer, like an idealized future verson of the <code>Framwork</code> laptop. But the efficient and economical thing to do today is to upgrade what I already have.</p>
<div class="heading-wrapper h3">
<h3 id="installed-the-extra-special-surface-linux-kernel">Installed the extra-special surface linux kernel</h3>
<a class="anchor" href="#installed-the-extra-special-surface-linux-kernel" aria-labelledby="installed-the-extra-special-surface-linux-kernel"><span hidden>#</span></a></div>
<p>I followed the instructions at the <a href="https://github.com/linux-surface/linux-surface">Linux Surface Go Kernel</a> GitHub repo.
It looks like this when done.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ uname -a
	Linux mycomputer 6.6.1-surface-1 ...etc...
</code></pre>
<div class="heading-wrapper h3">
<h3 id="the-wireless-fix">The Wireless Fix</h3>
<a class="anchor" href="#the-wireless-fix" aria-labelledby="the-wireless-fix"><span hidden>#</span></a></div>
<p>I followed this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SurfaceLinux/comments/9t53gq/wifi_fixed_on_surface_go_ubuntu_1810/">terrific guide on Reddit to Wifi on Surface Go</a>. It was written for Ubuntu 18.10, but it worked for me on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.</p>
<p>I used a cheap USB wifi adapter in order to find and read that guide, of course. Ubuntu has great support for no-name USB wifi dongles.</p>
<div class="heading-wrapper h3">
<h3 id="add-some-repositories">Add some repositories</h3>
<a class="anchor" href="#add-some-repositories" aria-labelledby="add-some-repositories"><span hidden>#</span></a></div>
<p>I added some repositories for <code>SurfaceLinux</code> and <code>VSCodium</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">deb [arch=amd64] https://pkg.surfacelinux.com/debian release main
deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/vscodium.gpg] https://download.vscodium.com/debs vscodium main
</code></pre>

<a class="anchor" href="#initial-reactions" aria-labelledby="initial-reactions"><span hidden>#</span></a></div>
<p>It's so fast! Windows 10 was snappy when I first bought it, but had gotten slow with time and usage.</p>
