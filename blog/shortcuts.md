## In VSCode

I have quick keys assigned to 
Alt+Shift+1 through Alt+Shift+6.

Here's a helpful mapping in VSCode.

1. Journal: New Journal Note
2. Journal: Open Today
3. Search: Focus on Search View
4. Source Control: Focus on Source Control View
5. Remote Explorer: Foucs on Remotes
6. View: Toggle Primary Side Bar Visibility

## In my personal Dashboard file

I have a bit of JavaScript in the HTML file I use for my homepage. It causes the above buttons to map to whatever I've set my 6 most visited sites to.

TODO: Add my script here.
