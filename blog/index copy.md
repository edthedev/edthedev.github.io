>Coming soon (whenever) - my honest thoughts on programming, but mostly about
>mentorship among programmers.

For as long as I can remember, the world has had a shortage of computer
 programmer skills.

The [Common Vulnerability Enumberation trends over time][1] show a clear
 shortage of experienced master programmers leading teams.

For as long as I can remember, we have predicted that the next bumper crop
 of programmers-in-college would address the shortage.

The world's colleges are graduating an excellent, but still insufficient,
number of programmers. More graduates did not solve the problem.

I believe this is because the attrition rate among new programmers is still very
high. Programming is an incredibly frustrating profession to learn.
