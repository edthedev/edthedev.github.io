Needed git.


Installed Crouton.
Installed a new chroot with xiwi

sudo sh ~/Downloads/crouton -t xiwi

sudo startxiwi -b xterm

Inside XTerm:

ssh-keygen

cp .ssh/id_rsa.pub ~/Downloads

sudo apt-get install git vim

# While that is running,  open ~/Downloads/.id_rsa.pub with a text editor within ChromeOS, and add it to my authorized keys on GitHub.

git clone git@github.com:edthedev/scratch_lessons
