# Installing XTerm, Git and Vim on Acer R11 Chromebook

I need git to do, well pretty much everything.
Git does not run natively on a Chromebook.
This was the last thing keeping my Acer R11 from being the best device ever created.

## How?

Git runs fine on Linux. Linux runs fine on Chromebook, inside a chroot, using [Crouton]().

## Steps

- Installed Crouton.
- Installed Ubuntu with Xiwi using Crouton

	> sudo sh ~/Downloads/crouton -t xiwi

- Installed the [Xiwi Chrome Plugin]()
- Launched XTerm inside the Chroot using Crouton

	> sudo startxiwi -b xterm

- Generated an SSH key (Inside XTerm)

	> ssh-keygen

- Copied the public key where ChromeOS can reach it.

	> cp .ssh/id_rsa.pub ~/Downloads

- Installed Git and Vim (within the XTerm) 

	> sudo apt-get install git vim

- While that was running, opened ~/Downloads/.id_rsa.pub with a text editor within ChromeOS, and added it to my [authorized keys on GitHub]().
- Cloned my project

	> git clone git@github.com:edthedev/scratch_lessons
