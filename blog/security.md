## Learning Resources for Cybersecurity

The OWASP Top Ten Vulnerabilities: https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/ Cybersecurity interviews will often have a question to get a feel for your familiarity with the OWASP top ten, and learning these 10 definitions helps when talking about cyberattacks. 

 The Cybersecurity color wheel is another useful tool for discussing and exploring Cybersecurity job roles. https://modoye.com/cybersecurity-color-wheel/ My team is actually "yellow team". We write code for Cybersecurity automation. Anecdotally, I think there are three most available jobs on "blue team", because setting up defenses is the core of the job role. My organization is large, and does not have a "red team" at all. Often "red team" work proactively finding problems is done as part-time work by blue and yellow teams, and through paid bug bounties, rather than full time internal staff. 


The OWASP Juice Shop is currently my favorite Cybersecurity learning tool. It's an intentionally vulnerable website that acts like a puzzle box - you use common vulnerabilities to break into it, and the more you learn the more layers become available to break into. It has some built in tutorials, and more hints can be found on Google. Also feel free to reach out to me - I'm working though it right now myself to improve my own skills with scanning tools. https://demo.owasp-juice.shop/#/ 

My favorite hint about OWASP Juice Shop is that all ethical hackers should look for the file "/.well-known/security.txt". A file with this name is often placed on web servers to tell ethical hackers what is allowed and where to report problems. In the case of OWASP Juice Shop, it also contains the URL of a scoreboard that gives hints and keeps track of your achievements.
