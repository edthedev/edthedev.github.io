## Usage Reminders

- `mod+v` - Open the next window *vertically* below the current window.

## Setup Reminders

- For a status bar, I like `polybar`
- For multiple monitor setup `xrandr` is very helpful.
- Configs are in `.config/i3`
- Reload your `i3` config with `mod+shift+c`
- Restart `i3` in place with `mod+shift+r` (helpful for testing startup programs)
