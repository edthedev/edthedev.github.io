- 

## Questions to Ask

- Tell me about a typical work day

> look for signs of time gaps in what should have been  easy automatic processes. Every company has some. Are they ones you can live with?
> Look for an admission that the team wastes some time together beacuse they actually like eachother
> Look for awareness of the manager schedule and the creative schedule. If there's no mention of the creative schedule, don't bet on innovating.

- Tell me about your disaster recovery plans.

> This answer directly scores the maturity of the organization. 
> This answer should determine how much savings you put aside against their company going abruptly out of business.
> Do their disaster recovery plans include provisions to protect customers, staff, C suite leaders, shareholders, and the general public? Whichever of these is missing can be very insightful.


- Tell me about your release schedule

> Look for signs of self respect.
> Do they release at 4:55 pm on Friday before a holiday weekend?
> Do they do tons of unreleased work?
> The correct answer is Monday through Thursday excluding holidays, targeting biweekly to monthly, with typical 5 day notice.

- Tell me about a time your team failed.

> Look for evidence of psychological safety.
> A team that can't handle failure will never achieve anything interesting.
> Great teams say what changed after the failure in the same breath as talking about it.
> Great leaders take responsibility for failure and use it to rally people to make improvements.
> Look for evidence that the failure was widely communicated. Shitty teams cover up failures with lies.
 
- In what ways does your teams processes differ from standard agile practices?

> "We don't quite do full agile" is the first sentence of the answer of any team that is really striving for agility.
> What are they striving for next? How frustrated will you be if you work there and they never achieve it?
> Do they do retrospectives every sprint? Teams without retrospectives aren't growing. They don't have to call it a retro, but it has to be happening. If it's not happening at the team level, then only certain (older white male long-tenured) staff are being consulted in the informal retros.
