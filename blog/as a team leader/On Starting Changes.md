# On Facilitating Change

Be the second dancer that kicks off a movement.

There's a few fleeting moments in your life when doing your dance will catch on.
But there's thousands of opportunities every year to be the second dancer who notices something someone else is doing and joins in, and cheers on everyone else who joins.

If you truly want to cause change - have the humility to find and join with people who are already making a difference.
