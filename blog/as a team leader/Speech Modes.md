# Speech Modes

Public Speaking (styled for an uncertaun audience) should always be used for groups of four or more. You can have a down to earth public olspeaking persona, but it needs to be free of assumptions of being understood. Be willing to say the same thing a few times in different ways. Speak to values and desired outcomes, not to specifics or details. Communicate up to 3 important points per half hour. Don't speak for more than a half hour.

Mistake - dropping into a more intimate mode of talking with larger groups. This alienates people through misunderstandings - most commonly a feeling of being talked over, past, around or - ironically "talked down to".

Probably self feeding - people accuse one of talking down, so one tried to repeat less, becomes less clear communicator, suffers from unclear communication, cycle repeats.

It's good in a small intimate group to assume everyone talking with you is an equal, but still take care to be respectful of differences in background, terminology, etc.
