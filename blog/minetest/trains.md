## Trains!

Everyone deserves a digital train set to play with.
Thanks to [Luanti / MineTest](https://www.minetest.net/), you can have one, and it's free!

## The Basics

Install your copy of [Luanti/MineTest](/blog/minetest).

Start a new game world with these settings:

- Game Engine: `MineGame`
- Mods: Search for `Trains` and install (and enable) anything with `Advanced Trains` in the name or description.
- Game Mode: `Creative`

## Build Your First Train

Follow the [Advanced Trains Tutorial](https://advtrains.de/wiki/doku.php?id=usage:howto).

> Tip: You're going to want to start with a big oval track to practice, so pay attention to where to place tracks in order to turn a corner.

## Clear space for your train

> Tip: If your train isn't speeding up or slowing down, it may be stuck.

It's best to clear a two block path on either side of your tracks, and around 7 blocks high at every point along the track.

> Tip: The train can get stuck on blocks right next to a slope. You'll need to clear the ground on either side of a sloped track block.
