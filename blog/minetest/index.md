## About

[MineTest][2] is an open source voxel game engine that lends itself particularly well to buidling things together with friends.

Here you will find my notes on running [MineGame][3] for friends and family.
Except where otherwise noted, my server is typically Ununtu and usual client is my SteamDeck.

## Articles

These are my notes on my setup. As always, this is ostensibly for your benefit. 

More honestly, these notes are so I can re-build my setup later after I inevitably mess it up while tinkering.
