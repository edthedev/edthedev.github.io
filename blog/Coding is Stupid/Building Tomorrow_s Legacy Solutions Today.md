All new feature work is to be done in the apprentice solution. If you don't have time to use the apprentice solution, then you can't afford this new feature.

But thou shalt faithfully trust in the legacy solution for any hotfix that doth fall on a Friday or any day off.

When thine eye wanders to a new apprentice solution, thou shalt choose the lesser used of the legacy or apprentice solution, and kill off all use of it with extreme care. By this ritual thine team shall earn the right to adopt this new solution as apprentice, whole naming the surviving system legacy.

If thou has not the willpower not cycles nor team commitment to retire one existing solution, then thou has not the right to adopt the a apprentice system, and it shall instead be called "shiny", and thou shall be advised that thou art "gold plating" when thou mention it.

If time new apprentice solution be truly necessary thou must first commit all the strength to the retirement of the current legacy solution. Then upon completion, thou shall frolic in the new apprentice solution.
