<p>The explicit goal of this text is to get called out for being full of shit.</p>
<p>Fear of looking silly has stagnated the growth of our profession.</p>
<p>If a subject isn't controversial or thought provoking, I hope not to cover it here.</p>
<p>Note: So many of us have been hurt pyschologically by this profession.</p>
<p>There's a hunger for stories that answer WTF about this field.</p>
<p>This book might just be a fun form of group therapy. I'm okay with that. That has value too.</p>
