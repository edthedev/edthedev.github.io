# Intro

The explicit goal of this text is to get called out for being full of shit.

Fear of looking silly has stagnated the growth of our profession.

If a subject isn't controversial or thought provoking, I hope not to cover it here.

Note: So many of us have been hurt pyschologically by this profession.

There's a hunger for stories that answer WTF about this field.

This book might just be a fun form of group therapy. I'm okay with that. That has value too.
