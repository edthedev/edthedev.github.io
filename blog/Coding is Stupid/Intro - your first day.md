# Intro - your first day

In your first year, you spend 75/% if you're time frustrated and confused that nothing works the eat you think it does.

In 20 years that percentage will shift by a lot. As you better understand your tools and your environment.  It'll end up closerc to 98% confused and frustrated and 2% of your time confident and productive productive.

But during that 2% you will be at least 20x more effective than your 25% is today.

You earn the right up take on much bigger and much harder problems.

## Get okay with being intimidated.

The lie we tell ourselves without realizing it is "Because I'm not smart enough or didn't work hard enough in the past to really understand what's going on, I had to work much harder now."

Working hard is great because it helps us better understand how little we truly understand. As long as you feel under qualified, you're probably doing fine.

But weirdly, you also need to learn to practice accurate self assessment when you're rocking it. Keep a daily victories file.

"There's always an Arquellian battle cruiser or a venusian death ray."

Chris Schroyer, Busey Bank CEO, told me "when you run hard, and you look up, you'll see you're in a pack of runners you can barely keep up with. It's a rarified group. You've left behind the people who you could confidently find yourself superior to. And that's a healthy thing."
