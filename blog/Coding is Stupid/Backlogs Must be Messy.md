# Backlogs must be Big, Messy and Actionable

"Backlogs must be Big, Messy and Actionable" title credit to my colleague
 Michelle Pitcel.

Backlogs should be big.
Backlogs are not queues. Time spent in the backlog should not be measured.

Backlogs must be messy. Nothing grows in a sterile garden.

- make unpleasant compromises
- like a compost pile - more and older is better. Shit turns into fertilizer.
- put off things that don't matter today - forever (or until they do matter)

Everything in the backlog should be actionable.

There's lots of actions we would take if we had time and resources. The backlog
 should contain those actions. The backlog starts to fail if it contains
 actions that we cannot actually act on when we have spare cycles.
