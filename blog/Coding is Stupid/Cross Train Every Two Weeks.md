# Cross Train Every Two Weeks

Every sprint thou shalt meet for 30 or so minutes to share with eachhother how clever you all are.

Super informal works really well, and might be the only way to keep up this pace.

For a small team, this is your sprint demo meetings.

For a team within a team, this is where you often repeat parts of your sprint demo meetings to a larger group who couldn't make the demo.

Fridays work great for this. Helps set the we're doing cool things, vibe before taking a break on the weekend.
