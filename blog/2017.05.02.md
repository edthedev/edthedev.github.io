## Blogging from ChromeBook 

I recently bought an [Acer R11 ChromeBook][3].
It's pretty great.

But you can't write code from it.

That's silly, of course. You can write code from anywhere, if you're desperate enough.
All you need is a napkin, a pen, and a very patient friend to serve as lexer, parser, compiler, and runtime error announcer.

Back to the Acer R11. For once in my life, I have a device that I haven't put into [developer mode][5]. I don't think I will need to. If you know me well, that's weird.

Instead, I set up an [Amazon EC2 instance][1], and installed Vim and Git on it.
With the [Chrome SSH Plugin][2], I now have all the luxuries offered by a high end AIX server in the 90s. What more could anyone want?

I intend to to make virtual retro computing into a thing.

Disclaimer: As perfect as this setup is, the Chrome SSH plugin cannot use the .pem file that Amazon provides without help from a [better computer with ssh tools preinstalled][4]. I had to use the MacBook to split my .pem file into a public and private key, then move them back to the Chromebook to use there.
