## I code a lot

I began programming in 1988.

I became a professional programmer in the year 2000.

I have written a lot software and I still enjoy writing software.

I currently write most of my software in:

- Python - My go-to all around language. Everyone should have one, and it should be Python. [There's a reason it is ranked so high on the Stack Overflow 2020 Top Language](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-popular-technologies)
- PowerShell - There's no better way to write shell scripts, and I write a lot of shell scripts.
- C - I still find C to be the simplest option for coding up a quick [bicycle speedometer](https://github.com/edthedev/arduino-bike-speed).
- Scratch - [I teach kids to code!](http://edward.delaporte.us/learn2code/)
- Commodore Basic 2.0 - I find it relaxing. Please don't judge me.

I am also fluent in:
- Bash / ZShell / KShell
- Batch Script
- CSharp.Net
- Java
- JavaScript / React.js / React Native
- Visual Basic (3, 4, 5, 6, and .Net)
- Perl
- PHP
- Power BI
- SQL
- VBScript / Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)

Frameworks and tools:
- React Native

I have also written software in:

- Angular.js
