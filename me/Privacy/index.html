<p>There is a lot more talk than action around privacy today. As a community, we need to have an open detailed discussion of what privacy standards we expect from in our governments, businesses and our communities.</p>
<p>I think the <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Top_10_Privacy_Risks_Project">OWASP Top Ten Privacy Risks</a> is a good start.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I have been a core contributor to the project in the past, so obviously, I have some bias.</p>
