<p>My favorite tools are <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Professional</a> and <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>.
I am falling in love with <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Code</a>, thanks to excellent plugins such as <a href="https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim">VsCode Vim Plugin</a>.</p>
<p>I have written a lot of code. You can read some of it online.</p>

<p><a href="https://mygoal.space">MyGoal.space</a> is my online task tool that puts the focus on goals and long term vision. This product is not open source, at this time.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/cites-illinois/Firefly">Firefly SSN Finder</a> is a fork of Cornell Spider that I did useability and memory management improvements to for the University of Illinois. I believe that Cornell Spider has integrated the best of my improvements into the core product, during the time since I did this work. This work also set the de-facto user experience for several commercial products published in the years since.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/edthedev/minion">Minion</a> is a note taker and task organizer. It achieves a fast user interface while still using only flat files for storage. It has a variety of interfaces, but I used it primarily from the command line or from within Vim (it includes a Vim plugin).</p>

<p>I write Arduino micro controller applications for fun.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://github.com/edthedev/arduino-bike-speed">Bicycle Speedometer</a> uses only about 8 dollars worth of hardware and some code to achieve what you could otherwise buy at Meijer for about 8 dollars.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/edthedev/bigredbutton">Big Red Button</a> adds an appropriate amount of theater to the sometimes underwhelming professional event 'hitting enter and then waiting'.</p>

<h2 id="mircobit">Mirco:Bit</h2>
<a class="anchor" href="#mircobit" aria-labelledby="mircobit"><span hidden>#</span></a></div>
<p>I recently got a couple of BBC Mirco:Bit mini computers. I'm excited about their applications to teaching children the core concepts of signal programming.
Plus, I finally made good on my threat to implement &quot;Button, Button, Whose got the Button?&quot;, replacing a fun game powered by a simple clothes button, with one that relies on circuits, batteries, radios and a bunch of JavaScript.</p>

<p>Before I wrote my <a href="https://github.com/edthedev/BinaryClock">Binary Clock Watch Face</a>, there were only 30 others on the Pebble app store!</p>
<p>I wrote <a href="https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/569d35184da1717a1f000043">Lift! for Pebble</a> (<a href="https://github.com/edthedev/LiftPebble">Source Code</a>) because none of the existing apps quite matched my usage pattern of 'Lift heavy thing. Push button to increment counter. Rest. Lift heavy thing.'</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/edthedev/time_reporting">Time Reporting Tool used at University of Illinois</a> bring bureaucratic data entry to the command line, where it feels most at home.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/edthedev/30-day-shopping">30 Day Shopping</a> is a simple web app for tracking whether I have yet wanted a particular toy for 30 days. It is about as complex to write as 'Todo List', but more fun, when adopting a new framework. So I have written this about 5 times. Some versions have more gold plating than others.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/edthedev/kiva_graphs">Graph Kiva Microloan Repayments</a> uses JavaScript and the Kiva loan API to make pictures out of loan repayments. This is meant to be a responsibilty tool. The theory is that a loan repaid on time is an indication that the loan recipient actually benefitted from the loan.</p>
<p><a href="https://bitbucket.org/edthedev/diceroller/src">Dice Roller</a> let's players simply visit the page, push buttons, and see eachother's rolls. This is another project that is fun to rewrite with the <a href="https://www.raymondcamden.com/2016/08/11/how-many-days-since-the-last-javascript-framework/">latest interesting trend</a>.</p>
