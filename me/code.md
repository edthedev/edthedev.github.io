## So I've written a lot of code

I began programming in 1988. I became a professional programmer in the year 2000. I have written a lot software and I still enjoy writing software.

I currently write most of my software in:

- Python is my 'go-to' all-around language. Everyone should have a favorite language, and it should be Python. [There's a reason it is ranked so high in the Stack Overflow 2020 Top Languages](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-popular-technologies)
- I also write plenty of shell scripts. There's no better scripting solution in 2023 than PowerShell. I still write plenty of Bash, too.
- GoLang is my 'go-to' for utilities that follow the Unix philosophy of doing one thing well.
- C is still often the most practical option on [interesting hardware](/robots)
- Scratch - [I teach kids to code!](http://edward.delaporte.us/learn2code/)
- Commodore Basic 2.0 - I find it relaxing. Don't judge me.
- JavaScript - I [make are with JavaScript](/art/live).

Over the years, I've also attained fluency in:

- JavaScript, jQuery, and React.js
- Bash, ZShell and KShell
- CSharp with .Net
- Django and Flask
- Java
- Node.js
- pandas
- Perl
- PHP
- Power BI
- SQL of all sorts

And I have also written software in:

- Angular.js
- Android Java
- AppleScript
- Batch Script
- BFs
- Borland C
- Commodore BASIC
- Haskell
- Ruby on Rails
- IBM Tivoli Directory Integrator
- Micro:Bit Block Code
- Micro:Bit JavaScript
- Objective C
- OCaml
- [/pikachu](Pikachu)
- Pebble native C
- Pebble JavaScript framework
- R Studio
- React Native
- RPG
- TypeScript
- VBScript / Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)
- VimScript
- Visual Basic (3, 4, 5, 6, and .Net)

I may have forgotten a few.
