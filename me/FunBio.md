How does this look to you for a hopefully Kahoot-sized IT ProFile?

‘CodeArt’

This soft-spoken cybersecurity superhero consults on software development lifecycle security and makes art with code. In his superhero toolkit, code pipelines can ‘make my worst workday a much better day.’

At previous IT Pro Forums, he’s presented on Git, Ansible, WordPress, and more, connecting the dots between usability, accessibility, security, and development lifecycles. 

Other known sightings:
Drinking tea
Juggling fire (no, really)
Presenting on Mjolnir, Stormbreaker, and configuration management
