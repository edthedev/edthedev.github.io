## Replaced vendor software with in house solutions

In spite of [XKCD's law of Automation](https://xkcd.com/1319/),
 it is possible to save a lot of time and money by automating things in-house.
Sometimes we can measure this savings.

- Loan Tracking - $250k annual savings moving from contracted to in-house maintenance.
- Mortgage Report Pipeline - Replaced $86k annual in consulting fees.
- Banker Visit Scheduling tool - Replaced $37k annual subscription.
