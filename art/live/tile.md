For various math reasons, this bit of playful coloring is not particularly related to the [Four Color Theorum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem).

However, this piece does lay some necessary foundation in the JavaScript code. In the source code you will find trivial algorithms for tracking which squares have been colored, and comparing colors with their neighbors.
