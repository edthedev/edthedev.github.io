Built from [Dots and Boxes](/art/live/dots_and_boxes), the primary purpose of this piece is to include far less unused code.

If I do enough art pieces with minimal imported code in mind, I should get my shared libraries pared down to single-purpose files.

While that's inconvenient to me, as a creator; it should be quite valuable to anyone reading along trying to learn to create art, or just understand more about JavaScript.
