[I make art with code.](/art/live) Each visitor experiences a unique piece of art on each visit. 

The source code for each piece is linked, and licenced so that you can copy and make it your own. 

Please let me know if you enjoyed it.


## Mix and Match Notecards

I often split my sketches across two note-cards, to create an ever-growing max-and-match card set for my children.

I have uploaded a [random selection of my mix-and-match cards](/art/mix) for your enjoyment.

## More Notecard Art

I also sketch in marker and colored pencil - mostly on Notecards.
