## How I learned to stop worrying, 
## and love `git revert`

Presented by [Edward Delaporte](mailto:edward.delaporte@busey.com)

for [Busey Bank](https://www.busey.com)

at [University of Illinois IT Professionals Forum](https://www.itproforum.illinois.edu/) on Nov 7, 2019.

- Git is elegant.
- Git is often nonsensical.

# Topics

1. Taking stock with `git status` and `git diff` 
2. Undo
3. The sometimes surprising results of `git revert` 
4. Frequently Asked Questions - Answered.
5. Pretty tools

---

# Taking Stock

*Where am I?*

>git status

*What have I done?*

>git diff

*What am I about to commit?*

>git diff --cached

???

- Visual tools and `git diff` are a great way to take stock.
- Most visual editors will have a right-click way to see git diff --cached
- If you see two separate threads of work in git diff --cached, it is time to check some work in.

Git Status
- think of an empty `git status` as a home base - return to it often.
- Anything in git status is an unresolved future problem
- untracked files not in gitignore
- unpushed or unpulled commits

---

## Undo

*That was a stupid change.*

>git reset HEAD .\ITProForum2019Spring.html

*Well that was a stupid commit.*

>git revert {commit hash}

???


---

# Sometimes Surprising Results of Git Revert

## git commit {first commit}

<img class='stretch left little' src='static/img/itpro2019fall/Trees1.PNG'/>

## git commit {second commit}
<img class='stretch little' src='static/img/itpro2019fall/Trees2_Expected.PNG'/>

---

# Sometimes Surprising Results of Git Revert

## git commit {third commit}
<img class='stretch left little' src='static/img/itpro2019fall/Trees3.PNG'/>

## git revert {third commit}
<img class='stretch little' src='static/img/itpro2019fall/Trees2_Expected.PNG'/>

???

- As expected, we went back in time to a previous state.
+ The Revert Revert pattern - today's stupid mistake is tomorrow's 'good enough'

---

# Sometimes Surprising Results of Git Revert

## git commit {third commit}
<img class='stretch left little' src='static/img/itpro2019fall/Trees3.PNG'/>

## git revert { second commit }
<img class='stretch little' src='static/img/itpro2019fall/Trees2.PNG'/>

???

- Surprise - this state has never existed in history.

# Your Questions

*What is the difference between `revert` and  `reset`?*

## Revert
- Will *not* lose your work.
- Acts *on* a commit.
- Supports the 'Revert Revert' pattern, that I love.

## Reset
- Takes you *to* a commit.
- Often *throws away* work!
- Can help you lie about what you actually did to get here.

???

- when in doubt, use git revert - reset can lose work, revert cannot.

- discuss the value of the revert a revert pattern
- when do we git reset? when our commit is being sent to Google or Facebook.

- Revert acts *ON* a commit.
- Reset acts *TO* a commit.


---

# Your Questions

*Someone checked in a password.*

- Change the password.

*How to fix a merge that contained incorrect files.*

- If it went really badly, throw away your local (merge) branch and fix the original branches.
- Otherwise, use the git tools to review and make correction, and commit the corrections.
- Copy/Paste is your friend.

---

# Your Questions

*Testing/writing code in different branches that use common local files.*

- Merge from your friend's branches early and often.
- Ignore your enemies' branches.
- Merge from `develop` and `master` early and often.
- Submit pull requests earlier and more often. 
- No one rejects a pull request for being too easy to review.

---

# Your Questions

*Letting different machines fall out of sync with origin and trying to merge work cleanly.*

- Start with `git pull`
- Use branches to experiment. Throw them away if they don't work.
- Copy/Paste is your friend.

---

# Your Questions

*Removing accidentally-checked in files from repos, without deleting them locally.*

> git rm --cached .\BadFile.txt

???

- You won't remember this next slide, 
- but you will remember that Copy/Paste is your friend.

---

# Your Questions

*How do I keep these two branches separate forever?*

> Separate the repositories. Everything in every branch is destined for master.

???

Separate branches forever?
- Think of branches as streams flowing together to become rivers.
- Anything you drop into any stream will someday reach the ocean (master branch).

---

# Your Questions

*I know what I want the final files to look like, but not how to get it there in git?*

> Copy/Paste is your friend.

???

Why is copy/paste great?
- Just make it right.
- Your history will show you got lost, and forced it right. That has value.

---

# Pretty Tools

[Tortoise Git](https://tortoisegit.org/)

- Add right-click menu items to Windows Explorer
- Like TortoiseSvn, but for Git

Atlassian SourceTree

- [Atlassian SourceTree for Mac and Windows](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) 

GitHub Desktop

- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

???

Tortoise - Right click can be fun

SourceTree
- Point and click your way through Git history
- Visual branch/merge history
- See past revisions
- Diff between arbitrary revisions
- Manage branches and branch operations in a visual way

---

# Pretty Tools

Visual Studio Code 

- [Free/Open/Cross Platform from Microsoft](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [GitLens Plugin](https://github.com/eamodio/vscode-gitlens/tree/master/#code-lens-)
- Other great plugins include: VsVim, RainbowCSV, Markdown Paste, Markdown PDF

???

VSCode 

- VsCode Handles git out of the box.
- Searching Git in the plugin marketplace returned 5 pages of results.
- Code Lens - see who changed which line last
- Various visual ways to explore history
- Native integrated shell

---

## Discussion

- This slide deck is online at http://Edward.Delaporte.us
- Need more git? Advanced Git session is after the break. 

???

- You can find this slide deck at Edward.Delaporte.us

# BONUS SLIDES

---

*I need a git server, but all I have is a Windows file share.*

>cd \\remote\share\folder.git\
>git init --bare

???

+ using a Windows folder like any other remote

## Can I do better at staging my un-commited work?

`git add --interactive`

Stage this hunk [y,n,q,a,d,e,?]?

???

+ Yes. You can.
+ Not as scary as it looks here.
+ Giving it a try can give you an idea of the possibilities.
+ You can point and click to get this effect too.

## How did line 9 of this file become so strange? 

`git log -L`

## How to protect `master`

```
#!/bin/sh

branch="$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)"

(At the repo)
Create file .git/hooks/pre-commit with following content:
if [ "$branch" = "master" ]; then
  echo "You can't commit directly to master branch"
  exit 1
fi
```
Make it executable (not required on Windows):
```
$ chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

[Full solution at Stack Overflow][10]
[10]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40462111/git-prevent-commits-in-master-branch

???

+ Git hooks are just shell scripts.
+ You can and should do more with them.
+ You can make your chat bot cuss out whoever broke the build or forgot to comment.

---

## What else can `git diff` do?

[Quite a bit][2]

[2]: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff

```
git diff [<options>] [<commit>] [--] [<path>…​]
git diff [<options>] --cached [<commit>] [--] [<path>…​]
git diff [<options>] <commit> <commit> [--] [<path>…​]
git diff [<options>] <blob> <blob>
git diff [<options>] --no-index [--] <path> <path>
```

???

- Diff can do more
- but the default target is the last commit
