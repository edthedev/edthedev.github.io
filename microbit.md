## Single Devic Demos

[Smiley](https://makecode.microbit.org/_fTx32C4f2Ao1)

I wanted a trivial demo to make my Microbit smile. So I wrote one in less time than it took me to realize that the same exact program was available in the second tutorial on the main site. Many of my ideas a very unoriginal. This is one. Ask me about the time I wrote a binary clockface for my Pebble smart watch.

[Count up to 5 of 5 different things](https://makecode.microbit.org/_Heid2TJmobLM)

Need to keep track of a small number of things, and only have an obscrure microchip and two AAA batteries? In that unlikely case, I have just the solution you're looking for!

[Strobe Nametag](https://makecode.microbit.org/_KvUaa2KjyE0C)

If I ever use Microbit as a name tag, I want a little extra pizzazz.

## Radio Demos

Micro:Bit is a terrific platform for learning asynchronous communication.


[Secret Messenger](https://makecode.microbit.org/_PLj13fcW50Wm)

Send messages to a friend's Micro:Bit, one bit LED at a time. Push A to send a blank space. Push B to send a lit LED. Push A and B to reset the grid.

[Button, Button, Whose got the Button?](https://makecode.microbit.org/_0me4RfVuuA0R)

Why play a terrific game with a simple clothes button, when you can use batteries, microchips, and radios instead?
