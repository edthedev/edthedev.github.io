# Why Git?

- An Annecdote
- [Stack Overflow on Git Usage](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/#work-version-control)

```
"Git is the dominant choice for version control for developers today, with almost 90% of developers checking in their code via Git."
- Stack Overflow 2018 Survey
```

```
"The majority of developers check in code multiple times per day. Professional developers are less likely to check in code rarely or never."
- Stack Overflow 2018 Survey
```

???

- Tell Annecode - I voted Mercurial. Everyone else voted git.
- Pull up linked Stack Overflow visual
- we use Git as a Microsoft shop
- Maybe scroll down to salary --- coincidence?

---

# Why Git?

```git init
git add *
git commit -a -m "Let's keep track of all this for later."
```

???

- It is everywhere. 
- Most linux environments already have it.
- Every worthwhile dev installs it.  (Including VSCode, which is good for a lot more than dev!)
- A few quick commands, and your future self thanks you.
