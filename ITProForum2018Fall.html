# Overview: 

- Why Git?
- Hands on with Git (and PowerShell)
- Quick Tour of some Tools
- Advanced Git Web Exercies
- Question / Answer
- Optional Bonus: Your First GitHub Pull Request

Slack Channel: https://rescuebots.slack.com

???

- Examples use PowerShell for consistency
- you can probably get by without PowerShell for these exercises.
- Remind me to take breaks. 
- Please ask questions as we go. 
- Interupt me. 
- Let's interact.
- You may finish early or run later, I'm here to support your learning.

# Why Git?

- An Annecdote
- [Stack Overflow on Git Usage](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/#work-version-control)
- Not just for Software Developers

"Git is the dominant choice for version control for developers today, with almost 90% of developers checking in their code via Git."

"The majority of developers check in code multiple times per day. Professional developers are less likely to check in code rarely or never."

Both quotes are from the Stack Overflow 2018 Survey

???

- Tell Annecode - I voted Mercurial. Everyone else voted git.
- Pull up linked Stack Overflow visual
- Busey is a fully Microsoft shop - we use Git 
- Maybe scroll down to salary --- coincidence?
- With Intrastructure as Code - Knowledge workers who are not developers are benefiting from developer tools
- You don't have to become a developer

---

# Why Git?

```powershell
	git init
	git add *
	git commit -a -m "Let's keep track of all this for later."
```

</a>

???

- It is everywhere. 
- Most linux environments already have it.
- Every worthwhile dev installs it.  (Including VSCode, which is good for a lot more than dev!)
- A few quick commands, and your future self thanks you.

# Git Tools Tour

<img class='flow' src='static/img/itpro2018fall/git_commit.png'/>

- VSCode
- Visual Studio Professional / Community
- Atlassian SourceTree

???

Other than Visual Studio Pro, these are free.

# Hands On with Git and PowerShell

.small[
"If that doesn't fix it, git.txt contains the phone number of a friend of mine who understands git. 

Just wait through a few minutes of 

'It's really pretty simple, just think of branches as...' 

and eventually you'll learn the commands that will fix everything."

[Git Exercies](https://github.com/edthedev/2018-git-lessons)
- Some Git Basics
- Create a Git Remote
- Push/Pull

???

- Ask for a volunteer to run the overhead.

# Learn Git Branching

https://learngitbranching.js.org/

- Branch
- Merge
- Rebase

# Questions Answered

Slides and links are online at http://edward.delaporte.us

???

- FAQ: I accidentally committed my password.
- FAQ: I accidentally committed and pushed my password.
- How to stage only certain commits for a pull request.
- Difference values of branching and forking.

- TU: keep the best of both timelines - checkout first branch, revert a mistake, switch back, rebase, merge

## Upcoming Lesssons

Offsite backup
  - delete all local files
  - restore from remote
  - Change to a new remote.

Stash / Stash apply

Tags
- Add a tag
- Push a tag
- Fetches tags
- Checkout a tag
- Reset to a tag

Branches
- Take it in a whole new direction in a branch.
- Diff our branch for code review
- Merge our branch.
- Rebase

Cherry Picking
- Revert an old commit.
- Cherry-pick a commit from another branch.
- Make a branch based on an old tag. (Let's try something different)


Taking a breather \ changing course
  - git stash
  - git branch

Collaborating
  - fetch, pull and rebase
  - code review
