### Principles

These are some principles that apply to any team I run.

- We take care of ourselves, our teammates and then our stakeholders - in that order.
- We value trust over process, but we understand that process builds trust.
- We maintain a roadmap, which we update as needed. It answers 'why' as well as 'what' we intend to do.
- Our schedules include time for: slack time (for responsiveness), recovery time (for the unexpected), and time for reflection (for growth and investment).
- We strive to do things the lazy, proud and impatient way whenever possible [see Laziness Impatience Hubris](https://wiki.c2.com/?LazinessImpatienceHubris). But we get the job done with humility, patience, and hard-work, when needed.
- No one is as smart toward the end of the work day as they wish they were. We go home and try again tomorrow.
- When we can't go home and try tomorrow, then we invite trusted colleagues to look over our shoulder, to help catch the extra mistakes due to fatigue.

### Committments to my Team

These are some committments I make to any team I run.

- Everyone gets a primary and a secondary assignment at all times. These may change at any moment, but I will consistently communicate which is which.
- I understand that time must pass between making something a primary assignment, and seeing meanginful progress on that assignment.
- No assignment gets assigned to less than 2 people. This builds in cross training and resilience to sick days. If an assignment is not important enough for 2 people to work on, then it is not important enough for 1 person to work on.
- Work with less than 1 lead assigned is, by definition, secondary priority (not primary). If it was primary, we would find a way to assign a lead. This also means that everyone's primary priority is aligned with a team lead's priorities.
- I will identity a single person to act as owner for each software product. It will typically be the person who suffers the most when the product is wrong.
