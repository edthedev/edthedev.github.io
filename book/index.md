## Introduction

>Coming soon (whenever) - an honest book about programming, but mostly about mentorship from both directions - being mentored and mentoring other programmers.

For as long as I can remember, we world has had too few computer programmers, and we have been predicting that the next bumper crop of programmers-in-college would address it. The world's colleges are now graduating an excellent, but still insufficient, number of programmers. More graduates did not solve the problem.

I believe this is because the attrition rate among new programmers is still very high. Programming is an incredibly frustrating profession to learn.

I believe that the trade of computer programming is only hanging on by the force of effective mentorship. And even if it's not, the gap between an apprentice programmer and a trained master can be measured, using the [Common Vulnerability Enumberation trends over time][1].

Let's try to maximize the effects of that mentorship. If that resonates with you, you may enjoy this book - or you should help me write it.
