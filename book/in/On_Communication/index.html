<a class="anchor" href="#on-communicating-as-a-leader" aria-labelledby="on-communicating-as-a-leader"><span hidden>#</span></a></div>
<p>Principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a Safe Space</li>
<li>Never assume you have been understood. You have not.</li>
<li>Take care whenever you cannot read each audience member's face for feedback.</li>
<li>Slow down.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why do I have these principles?</p>
<p>During my professional life, I have developed thick skin.
I have found this thick-skin can lead me to carelessness toward others.</p>
<p>These rules help me cause less harm as I rampage along passionately describing ideas I want to share.</p>
<div class="heading-wrapper h2">
<h2 id="on-creating-safe-spaces-for-communication">On Creating Safe Spaces for communication</h2>
<a class="anchor" href="#on-creating-safe-spaces-for-communication" aria-labelledby="on-creating-safe-spaces-for-communication"><span hidden>#</span></a></div>
<p>Create a safe space. This could be a very bad day for your audience. Everyone is dealing with things they don't talk about.
At a bare minimum, the person you are talking to is probably dealing with some background anxiety, impostor syndrome and stage fright.</p>
<p>If you can be the safe voice that props them up before they get out on stage, you'll be their go-to when it matters.</p>
<div class="heading-wrapper h2">
<h2 id="on-being-understood">On Being Understood</h2>
<a class="anchor" href="#on-being-understood" aria-labelledby="on-being-understood"><span hidden>#</span></a></div>
<p>You were not understood. Repeat the message over and over.
Never assume that it is widely understood. It <em>still</em> is not.</p>
<p>In Discworld, &quot;The Wizard who has tired of checking their food for poisons, has tired of life itself.&quot; Similarly, the professional who has tired of explaining fundamental concepts of their job - has tired of being paid to do that job.</p>
<p>How many times must you explain this concept? To quote a Pirates of the Carribean, &quot;As always, Miss Swan, at least once more.&quot;</p>
<p>Be willing to say the same thing a few times in different ways. Speak to values and desired outcomes, not to specifics or details. Communicate up to 3 important points per half hour. Don't speak for more than a half hour.</p>
<div class="heading-wrapper h2">
<h2 id="speak-as-simply-and-clearly-as-possible-to-larger-groups">Speak as simply and clearly as possible to larger groups</h2>
<a class="anchor" href="#speak-as-simply-and-clearly-as-possible-to-larger-groups" aria-labelledby="speak-as-simply-and-clearly-as-possible-to-larger-groups"><span hidden>#</span></a></div>
<p>Take care when speaking whenever you cannot read each audience member's face for feedback.</p>
<p>Public Speaking (styled for an uncertaun audience) should always be used for groups of four or more.
You can still maintain a down-to-earth public speaking persona, but it needs to be free of assumptions of being understood.
The ability in a smaller group to notice facial reactions at moments of misunderstanding is not available while speaking to larger groups.
This situation requires caution.</p>
<p>Seeing everyone in the audience as an equal can lead to the mis-step of assuming they have identical understanding of the topic, identical experiences and identical assumptions to ones own. In these conditions, miscommunication is practically guarteed.</p>
<div class="heading-wrapper h2">
<h2 id="slow-down">Slow Down</h2>
<a class="anchor" href="#slow-down" aria-labelledby="slow-down"><span hidden>#</span></a></div>
<p>People tend to speak faster when their heart is racing with nervousness or excitement.
It's excellent to embrace opportunities to speak when nervous or passionate, or ideally both.</p>
<p>But the principles discussed above cannot be practiced in a hurry.</p>
<p>The trivial mantra 'slow down' is the first starting point of adopting the principles above.</p>
