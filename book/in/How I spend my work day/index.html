<p>(As a free person)</p>
<p>I gave up on compartmentalizing my work day years ago.</p>
<p>My self-imposed number one responsibility during work hours is to be available to current and past colleagues.</p>
<p>My self imposed number two responsibility is to invest in my career - which means doing something that moves me toward:</p>
<ul>
<li>retiring successfully</li>
<li>Greater job satisfaction</li>
<li>Greater job impact on the world</li>
</ul>
<p>Most days, those motives and my assigned work love up exactly, because I've been doing this long enough that ice achieved a high alignment between my goals and my professional role.</p>
<p>But in days when it doesn't, I take care of the thing that matters to me and I don't apologize to anyone for doing so. Turns out no one actually minds.</p>
<p>How to get there:</p>
<p>Learn what the minimum to not get fired is. Do that minimum as a matter of routine. Then invest the rest of the time into self development.</p>
<p>No one even considers this selfish or lazy - it's above and beyond the minimum most others are doing - any time the self investment benefits the firm!</p>
<p>And any time the firm realizes it's preferential goals for you differ from your own, you look like a go-getter - the sort of person the firm might want to make allowances to keep around.</p>
