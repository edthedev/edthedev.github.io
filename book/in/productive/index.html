  <h1> Managing a Productive Team </h1>

  <p>As managers, we often feel compelled to ask:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;How do I get the most out of my team?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I have learned to ask myself, <em>instead</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>”How do I get the most from my team <em>that matters</em> to the <em>mission</em> of <em>my organization</em>?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I accepted that the second question matters, my approach to task management flipped on its head.</p>
<p>As I have worked diligently to enable work that matters, I have discovered that <em>less is more</em>.</p>
<p>It is not my job to encourage my team to <em>do more</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is my job to encourage my team to <em>focus on work that matters</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love juggling, so we're going to talk about juggling. I don't have a better transition here. Hopefully it will make sense in a minute.</p>
<p>When juggling in a group, there are more successful throws if the count of objects in motion stays <em>below</em> what the team can currently handle. Stretching the metaphor, it also matters that only correct expected matching objects are being thrown. Flaming torches are only acceptable when the team has <em>trained extensively</em> to juggle flaming torches and <em>is expecting</em> flaming torches to be thrown at them.</p>
<p>So my job as manager is not to <em>encourage more throws</em>, or to <em>scold people who fail to catch</em>.</p>
<p>My job is to <em>prevent throws that are valueless or  disruptive</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My job is often simply to stop a junior team member from tossing an unexpected chainsaw into the mix!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it is my job to do this over and over and over, as needed.</p>
<p>When things are calm, it's also my job to count throws. I do this exclusively to brag to leadership. I brag to leadership exclusively to earn credibility.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I use earned credibility - to prevent leadership from throwing unexpected chainsaws into the mix.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also do a lot of coaching, but coaching is work I can delegate to my team leads.</p>
<p>I'm summary, my job, as manager, accountable for teams productivity, is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Stop useless work from proceeding at the expense of work that matters</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
