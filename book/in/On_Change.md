## Implementing Changes

I typically take two one on one meetings for any change in an individuals
responsibilities. First to discuss. Second for the team member to bring back
questions, comments, concerns.

I also commit to not changing team-wide processes except during my sprint
retrospective meetings.

Both of these are on a two week cycle, and I never miss them (always reschedule
if conflicted.)

In the retro, I require every team member to chime in on every change with a
vote of "strong yes", "meh" or "no". A change can be implemented with a
combination of "strong yes" and "meh". But a single "no" means we take a step
back from the proposed change and re-evaluate, reword, and/or discuss the
outcome I am after in more detail. Sometimes a change waits a sprint and we
discuss again in two weeks.

Any change I need can probably wait a month, because the process results in
teams that work.

Sometimes the team convenes to suspend a recent change during a stand-up
 meeting. When that happens, I declare the change out of use, and we discuss and
  vote again (usually to never try that painful approach again) at next retro.

## Discussing Changes

Expert, but humble.

+ Empathetic but resolute.
+ At minimum, we meet our commitments unrushed, with empathy.
+ We make space for solutions to be found.
+ We close gaps in process and tech.

Kind throughout.

+ We listen and we advise - both a kindness.
+ We research, and recommend. We teach and mentor. These are kindnesses.
+ At our best we deliver underserved kindnesses.

When making recommendations for others, we make a conscious choice to speak from
our own experience, without projecting.
    - The simplest step is to replace "you should" with "we have needed to".

We bless the tech that got a team where it is today.

+ Avoid negative words - they worked hard on their piece-of-crap solution.
+ Encourage parallel deployment.
+ Don't aks them to give up a mature solution, ask them to enhance it.
+ Everyone's baby is ugly, but it's still their baby.
