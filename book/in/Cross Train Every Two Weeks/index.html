<p>Every sprint thou shalt meet for 30 or so minutes to share with eachhother how clever you all are.</p>
<p>Super informal works really well, and might be the only way to keep up this pace.</p>
<p>For a small team, this is your sprint demo meetings.</p>
<p>For a team within a team, this is where you often repeat parts of your sprint demo meetings to a larger group who couldn't make the demo.</p>
<p>Fridays work great for this. Helps set the we're doing cool things, vibe before taking a break on the weekend.</p>
