<p>Organizations are better off when decsiions have input from everyone who has a perspective that can help.</p>
<p>But this leads to paralysis if no one is empowered to say 'go' or to shout 'stop'.</p>
<p>Organizations where anyone can say 'stop' survive much longer, but eventually die because they 'stop' when they needed to 'go'.</p>
<p>Organiziations where the boss says 'go' and 'stop' are agile, but deeply stupid. I'm inclined to believe they usually don't last as long as the ones where anyone can say 'stop'.</p>
<p>So what's the solution?</p>
<p>Everyone can give input. That doesn't take any time cost at all in the current information age. Everyone should be empowered (within reason) to throw the 'stop' command, according to usual 'boy who cried wolf' rules - three strikes, do a retrospective, train them on why they need to stop shouting stop needlessly, fire them if they cannot learn, and their 'stop' is constantly found needless in the retrospective.</p>
<p>That's all fine and dandy, but who gets to say 'go'? Should I, as the deeply disconnected (from business and reality itself) shareholder? Certainly not. Should the CEO, have to approve every single 'go' motion the organization makes? Can they even type fast enough?</p>
<p>The solution is elegant, and provided by nature. THe answer is pain.</p>
<p>The 'go' order must come from the person who feels the pain <em>most immediately</em> if the risk isn't panning out. As the person who knows most how it might hurt, their buy-in is by far the best indicator if the needed preparation has been done to safely move from 'stop' to 'go'.</p>
<p>People who I explain this to routinely and normally wildly underestimate how fast their lowly Ops person will get to 'go'.
I hear stuipid things like &quot;they don't understand the pressure we're under&quot;. No, if <em>you</em> are under that much pressure, then <em>you</em> can align the whole organization behind getting that lowly Ops person to a state where they're comfortable with 'go'. You're the CEO, you can do that. You already wield tremendous positional authority. Instead of using it to forge ahead with a dumb idea; you can use it to align everyone to fix the safety concerns coming out of Ops. You will be glad you did. So will everyone else.</p>
<p>But what everyone misses is that the Ops person who will feel the pain says 'go' <em>much sooner</em> than a project manager, or a team lead, or an architect does. The Ops person has a dizzing amount of knowledge of the true risks involved, and how much the organization can tolerate.</p>
<p>And this is the 'end of business' vs 'successful company' difference in this principle. When it's honestly time for the organization to do the professional equivalent of running on an injured ankle - the front-line Ops person is the only person who will make the call to 'go' quickly enough for the organization to survive.</p>
<p>So when you're consensus gathering with a big group, and themperature seems right to move forward, but no one is ready to lead the charge. As the leader, rather than just making the call - delegate it to the Ops person who feels the pain from the change the most. Ask them to approve it &quot;as soon as they feel comfortable&quot;, and see what happens. The approval usually happens faster than I would have given, and in key cases happens slower than I would have given - long before the project plan checklist is completed - while driving out real needs that weren't on anyone's project plan.</p>
