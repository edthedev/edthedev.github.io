# My Top Three Rules of Software Development
Individual software developers can apply these, but they work best if the whole team adopts them as a culture.

## 1. If you need to maintain it, break it often.
You cannot reasonably expect to maintain something you have never broken. If you think using it a certain way might be an incredibly bad idea, set up a test environment and give it a go. That way you'll know what to do with it when nature invariably creates those same conditions someday.

Needless to say, you cannot really live this rule unless you have mature backup, recovery and version control systems.

## 2. Sharpen Your Axe

Spend 90% of your time finding out what you don't know how to do, and whether you do know how to do what you're doing.

Spend the remaining 10% of your time making and doing. Your remaining 10% will go farther than most people's 110%.

This is crucial for people who manage software developers to understand. Software developers are axes that need sharpened. Send them to training regularly. Make extra time for them to try something again when you can tell they are uncomfortable with it.

Netflix famously has a rule that their staff competency must always be ahead of their product complexity. This is equivalent to saying that the axe should be sharper than the tree is hard; and that the development team should be overqualified for the product they are building.

Developers become overqualified with practice. Make time to practice. 

## 3. Suck Less

Follow the law of 1% improvement and compounding interest. If you can average less than a 1% improvement in your product each day, you'll still have a 300% better product every year.

We know that statistically most software projects fail, and most software changes range between unpleasant and disasterous. Tiny changes succeed are the only changes with a reasonable success rate.

You can try 365 times to make a 500% improvement and fail every time, but you can probably achieve a 1% improvement with startling regularity, with practice.

Make things just a tiny bit better every day, and the customers will stick with you until you have something pretty decent.

## 4. The right people, treated the right way, make any technology sufficient.

I have seen low quality technology stacks being used to do really cool things, and high quality software going to waste. 

The mantra to repeat is: Technology facilitates people.

Invest in the tech that your people need.

If your people need a certain tech badly, you might hire another person to support that tech. But that should be the exception, because the tech doesn't produce anything on it's own.

The moment anyone thinks that the tech itself is important, you're going to have a bad time.

Without the right people, the right technology cannot be competitive.
