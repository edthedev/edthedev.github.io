# My Top Three Rules of Software Development
Individual software developers can apply these, but they work best if the whole team adopts them as a culture.

## 1. If you need to maintain it, break it often.
You cannot reasonably expect to maintain something you have never broken. If you think using it a certain way might be an incredibly bad idea, set up a test environment and give it a go. That way you'll know what to do with it when nature invariably creates those same conditions someday.

Needless to say, you cannot really live this rule unless you have mature backup, recovery and version control systems.
