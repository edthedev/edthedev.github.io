Dear Princess Celestia: Hello World.

Today I learned about zigzags:

Did you know Spike likes "/\\//\/\\\/\///\/\////\/\/\/\/\/\/\///\\"?
Did you know Rainbow Dash likes "///////\\//\/\\\\/\/\/\/\///\\/\/\/\/\/\"?

I did this 9 times:

I quickly said Spike.
I quickly said Rainbow Dash.
I said Spike.
I quickly said Rainbow Dash.
I quickly said Spike.
I said Spike.

That's what I did.

Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle.
