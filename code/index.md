# Code

I have written a lot of code. 

For my recent precessional work,
browse my latest public work [on my GitHub](https://github.com/edthedev).

If you're curious about the variety of my experience, follow the links you find here.

## My Code

I started programming in the 1980s,
so retro code will always have a place in my heart.

My weekend coding for fun includes:

+ [C6 / X16 BASIC](/basic)
+ [Retro Games in Python](https://github.com/edthedev/tmntcade)

I cannot pay back the debts I owe to those who 
helped me grow as a programmer, but I can pay it foward by helping others.

Here are some resources I have created to help others learn to code.

+ [Learn to Code](/learn2code)
+ [Tutorials for the Scratch Beginner Programming Lanaguage](https://github.com/edthedev/scratch_lessons)

I do a decent amount of programming in my free time 
Just to make my life easier. Don't expect mature open source projects, these are quick utilities.

+ [CLI Chart tool in Go Language](https://github.com/edthedev/chart)
+ [JavaScript Workout tracker for the Pebble Smart Watch](https://github.com/edthedev/LiftPebble)
+ [ReactJS JavaScript and Python Goal Tracker](https://github.com/edthedev/MyGoal.space)
+ [JavaScript Chart.js Graphs for Kiva Lending Data](https://github.com/edthedev/kiva_graphs)
+ [Web Test Automation with RobotFramework](https://github.com/edthedev/Learn_RobotFramework_IllinoisPTR)
+ [Infrastructure as Code for Ansible to Manage AWS](/code/infra)

I also do a decent amount of coding that simply amuses me.
These aren't even good ideas, but I wanted them so I wrote them.

+ [Arduino C Code Bicycle Speedomoter](https://github.com/edthedev/arduino-bike-speed)
+ [Arduino C Code to make a Big Red Button press the Enter Key](https://github.com/edthedev/bigredbutton)
+ [JavaScript Binary Watch face for the Pebble Smart Watch](https://github.com/edthedev/BinaryClock)

## My Small Contributions to Big Projects

I have contributed in small ways to some big projects.

Thanks to GitHub listing them under my Arctic Vault Contributor profile badge, 
I know some of the most prominent packages that have accepted my pull requests. 
I don't remember exact details. I do recall that I have addressed 
some obnoxious errors with relatively trivial changes. 

In may favorite case, I helped address an issue that had suffered months of optimization debate.
 My pull requst added a new message that said simply "This step may take upwards of ten minutes on the first run. Maybe go get a coffee." 

I still sometimes reflect on the number of new users happily drinking a coffee instead of debugging and then re-opening that same issue.

+ [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native)
+ [Angular JS](https://github.com/angular/angular.js)
+ [Kivy](https://github.com/kivy/kivy)
