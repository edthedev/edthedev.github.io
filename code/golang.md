## On Charm

Go is suprisingly charming, for a pedantic little @#$!

Go refuses to let me waste any precious **speed**. 

But if I wanted a quick practical script, Perl, Python, and PowerShell all exist. 

> "How will you feel pulling up to the starting line of a street race in `PowerShell`?" - GoLang asks me, accusingly.

## On Adoption

Before I take my place among the **Fast & Furious**, I need to make peace with iteratively learning Go.

My steps for adopting Go were:

1. Write a bit of code and run the program. 

> Go is **fast**. It spits out a syntax error **fast**.

2. Read the error to learn that - no, I must not do what I have done, in the manner I selected. 

> GoLang knows better. And now, I also know better.

3. Search for answers

> Searching any topic yields either a short lesson in advanced computer science, or advice on tuning my code before an illegal street race. Sometimes both.

4. Scroll past posts that explain how much faster my solution is going to be, because Go requires that I follow street racing rules.

> Go requires that I follow street racing rules.

5. Discover that the function I am looking for is built in, but has a quirky name.
6.  Read the function docs.

> The docs are mostly warnings that built-in functions may not do exactly what I need, or even worse, they may be **slower**.

7.  Briefly consider honoring the spirit of GoLang with a hand-crafted artisnal function.
8. Realize that life is short. 
9. Use the built-in function.
10. Go to line 1.
