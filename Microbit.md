## Microbit Projects

### Single Device Demos

[Smiley](https://makecode.microbit.org/_fTx32C4f2Ao1)

I wanted a trivial demo to make my Microbit smile. So I wrote one in less time than it took me to realize that the same exact program was available in the second tutorial on the main site. Many of my ideas a very unoriginal. This is one. Ask me about the time I wrote a binary clockface for my Pebble smart watch.

[Count up to 5 of 5 different things](https://makecode.microbit.org/_Heid2TJmobLM)

Need to keep track of a small number of things, and only have an obscrure microchip and two AAA batteries? In that unlikely case, I have just the solution you're looking for!

[Strobe Nametag](https://makecode.microbit.org/_KvUaa2KjyE0C)

If I ever use Microbit as a name tag, I want a little extra pizzazz.

### Radio Demos

Micro:Bit is a terrific platform for learning asynchronous communication.

[Secret Messenger](https://makecode.microbit.org/_PLj13fcW50Wm)

Send messages to a friend's Micro:Bit, one bit LED at a time. Push A to send a blank space. Push B to send a lit LED. Push A and B to reset the grid.

[Button, Button, Whose got the Button?](https://makecode.microbit.org/_0me4RfVuuA0R)

Why play a terrific game with a simple clothes button, when you can use batteries, microchips, and radios instead?

### Robot Frame Demos

The [RingBig Car][1] frame is the most affordable robot body I have found.
[Wanderer](https://makecode.microbit.org/_MeWdP5dk9ELC) is a simple demonstration program that makes it wander randomly around the room. This is for an older version of the MicroBit framework, so it can be hard to find the RingBit control library without a direct link, at the moment.

[Dancing Friends][2] is the wandering bots program above, modified so that every ten seconds or so, one of the robots will call out for all the robots to spin in a circle.

### WaveShare Joystick for Micro:Bit

[Musical Gamepad][3] turns your WaveShare Joystick into a primitive Midi keyboard. This was my first test that the library and hardware are compatible. And the WaveShare Joystick can sing!

### Remote Control your RingBitCar

What could be more fun than having a remote control robot?

Download [Remote Control - RingBitCar][4] to your RingBitCar, and [Remote Control - WaveShare Joystick][5] to your WaveShare JoyStick and enjoy!
