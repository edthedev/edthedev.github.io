# Edward Delaporte's Blog

Welcome to EdTheDev's Blog on programming, art and education.

In this space I share short technology guides and occassional art. 

## Professional Stuff

Since I named the site after myself, it is only fair that I share [a bit about myself](/me).

I suspect that most visits here are looking for one of [my slide decks](/slides).

## Code Generated Art

</a>

[I make art with code.](/art/live) Each visitor experiences a unique piece of art on each visit. 

The source code for each piece is linked, and licenced so that you can copy and make it your own. 

Please let me know if you enjoyed it.


## On Coding

I've been coding for a long time.

- [Some of my Code](/code)
- [Learn to Code](/learn2code) - I maintain a list of my favorite resources for learning to code.
- [Coding in BASIC](/basic) - I still write BASIC code.
- [Make a Robot](/robots) - You should make a robot.


## Other Art

I also sketch with marker and colored pencil, mostly on 3x5 cards.
