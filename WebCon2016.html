# RouteConfig.cs

The MVC template comes with this:
.small[
```CSharp
public class RouteConfig {
    public static void RegisterRoutes(RouteCollection routes) {

        routes.MapRoute(
            name: "Default",
            url: "{controller}/{action}/{id}",
        );

    }
}
```
]

***

.small[
```CSharp
public class PaymentsController : Controller {
    [HttpGet]
    public ActionResult Single() {
        /// ... Omitted ...
    }
}
```
]

???

- URLS are determined by controller class names.
- Great URLs never change.
- Great code changes often.
- Controller class names should not be tied to routes.

# RouteConfig.cs
Use this instead:
.small[
```CSharp
public class RouteConfig {
    public static void RegisterRoutes(RouteCollection routes) {

        routes.MapMvcAttributeRoutes();

    }
}
```
]

***
.small[
```CSharp
public class SensibleNameController : Controller {
    [HttpGet]
    [Route("Payments/Single")]
    public ActionResult SensibleName() {
        /// ... Omitted ...
    }
}

```
]
???

- Change controller name without changing URL.
- Better! - Change URL without renaming controller.
- Bonus - Keep your sanity by keeping your routes next to your controllers.

# ViewModel.cs
# View.cs
# _PartialView.cs
# Scripts/UserExperience.js
???
- User experience is important.
- User experience belongs as close to the user as possible, so it goes in the JavaScript.
- Think of Razor View as Initial View. 
        - JavaScript takes over.
        - But! Getting it right on the first try still has value.
- JavaScript increases accessibility, by improving user experience.
- JavaScript is no longer a significant source of vulnerability. 
        - Tell your paranoid friends they can turn it back on.
        - Tell them to update their browser first.
