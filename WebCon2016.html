# What?
- Minimal lines of example code for a working web application in ASP.Net MVC with React.js
- Answers for each bit: What do I recommend? Why?

# Overview
- Cool stuff that comes with MVC
    - Clean static URLs with MapMvcAttributeRoutes
    - Fast forms and tables with Razor and ViewModels.
    - Refresh client view using AJAX to fetch HTML from server side partials.
        - Want to spend some time on this vs React.js, Pro/Con list.
- Cool stuff that comes with React.js
    - Client side rendering with JSX.
    - JavaScript event based updates.
- Cool stuff that comes with React.js.Net
    - React Bundling
    - Server side rendering of JSX
- Example Code
- Things we did not have time to cover.
    (I plan to add web URLs to resources for each...)
    - NuGet
    - Linq
    - Web.config transforms

# Example GET
- GET diagram
- Raw GET request
- RouteConfig.cs
- Controller.cs
- Razor Table from ViewModel

# Example POST 
- POST diagram
- Raw POST request
- Razor Form from ViewModel
- jQuery POST
- Controller.cs

# Other stuff...
- Razor Form from ViewModel
- Submit Razor Form with JavaScript
- Bundling JavaScript
- React Bundle

# Lessons

- "Cool URIs don't change." (Tim Berner's Lee, _Weaving the Web_, 1999)
- Render (most) HTML server side.

???

- URL = URI
- People like to bookmark things.
- URL should reflect purpose.
- New thing? New purpose? New URL.
- Redirects are a thing. Use them.
- Online article: [W3.org Style Guide - Cool URIs don't change](https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI.html)

---

# Examples
- RouteConfig.cs

---

# GET Request

```
    Request URL: https://example.com/Payments/Single
    Request Method:GET
    Status Code:200 OK
    Remote Address:10.55.36.184:8080
```

???
- Reminder / Context
- Plain Text
- Returned HTML and status code 200 OK
- Payments/Single

---


# RouteConfig.cs

The MVC template comes with a 'RouteConfig.cs' like this:
.small[
```CSharp
public class RouteConfig {
    public static void RegisterRoutes(RouteCollection routes) {

        routes.MapRoute(
            name: "Default",
            url: "{controller}/{action}/{id}",
        );

    }
}
```
]

***

.small[
```CSharp
public class PaymentsController : Controller {
    [HttpGet]
    public ActionResult Single() {
        /// ... Omitted ...
    }
}
```
]

???

- URLS are determined by controller class names.
- Great URLs never change.
- Great code changes often.
- Controller class names should not be tied to routes.

---

# RouteConfig.cs

Use this instead:
.small[
```CSharp
public class RouteConfig {
    public static void RegisterRoutes(RouteCollection routes) {

        routes.MapMvcAttributeRoutes();

    }
}
```
]

***
.small[
```CSharp
public class SensibleNameController : Controller {
    [HttpGet]
    [Route("Payments/Single")]
    public ActionResult SensibleName() {
        /// ... Omitted ...
    }
}

```
]
???

- Change controller name without changing URL.
- Better! - Change URL without renaming controller.
- Bonus - Keep your sanity by keeping your routes next to your controllers.

# _PartialTable.cshtml

MVC can generate something like this from the ViewModel:
.small[
```CSharp

@model IEnumerable<RateCompareWeb.ViewModels.RateViewModel>
@{
    Layout = null;
}

<table id="rateTable" class="table table-condensed">
    <tr> 
        <th> @Html.DisplayNameFor(model => model.Provider) </th>
        ... More headers ...
    </tr>

    @foreach (var item in Model) {
    <tr class="@( item.IsOurRate ? " our_rate":"")">
        <td> @Html.DisplayFor(modelItem => item.Provider) </td>
        ... More Row Data ...
    </tr>
    }
</table>

```
]

???

- This is great. We love it.

# _PartialTable.cshtml

MVC can generate something like this from the ViewModel:
![Rate Table Parial](static/img/webcon2016/ratepartial.png)

???

- Added CSS for Bold first row.

        # ViewModel.cs
        # View.cs
        # _PartialView.cs
        # Scripts/UserExperience.js
        ???
        - User experience is important.
        - User experience belongs as close to the user as possible, so it goes in the JavaScript.
        - Think of Razor View as Initial View.
        - JavaScript takes over.
        - But! Getting it right on the first try still has value.
        - JavaScript increases accessibility, by improving user experience.
        - JavaScript is no longer a significant source of vulnerability.
        - Tell your paranoid friends they can turn it back on.
        - Tell them to update their browser first.
