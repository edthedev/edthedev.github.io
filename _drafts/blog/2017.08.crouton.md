# Installing XTerm, Git and Vim on Acer R11 Chromebook

I need git to do, well pretty much everything.
Git does not run natively on a Chromebook.
This was the last thing keeping my [Acer R11 Chromebook](https://www.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/series/acerchromebookr11) from being the [best device ever](https://github.com/edthedev/edthedev.github.io/blob/master/blog/2017.05.02.blog.from.chromebook.md).

## How?

Git runs fine on Linux. Linux runs fine on Chromebook, inside a chroot, using [Crouton](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton).

## Steps

- [Enabled Chrome Developer Mode](https://www.howtogeek.com/210817/how-to-enable-developer-mode-on-your-chromebook/) This involved a [Power Wash](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/183084?hl=en). For me, nothing was lost during the process.
- Installed Crouton.
- Installed Ubuntu with Xiwi using Crouton

	> sudo sh ~/Downloads/crouton -t xiwi

- Installed the [Xiwi Chrome Plugin](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/wiki/crouton-in-a-Chromium-OS-window-(xiwi))
- Launched XTerm inside the Chroot using Crouton

	> sudo startxiwi -b xterm

- Generated an SSH key (Inside XTerm)

	> ssh-keygen

- Copied the public key where ChromeOS can reach it.

	> cp .ssh/id_rsa.pub ~/Downloads

- Installed Git and Vim (within the XTerm) 

	> sudo apt-get install git vim

- While that was running, opened ~/Downloads/.id_rsa.pub with a text editor within ChromeOS, and added it to my [authorized keys on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/).
- Cloned my project

	> git clone git@github.com:edthedev/scratch_lessons
