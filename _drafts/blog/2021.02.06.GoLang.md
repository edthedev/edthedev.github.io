# The Charm of Go Language

## On Charm

Go is suprisingly charming, for a pedantic little @#$%!


Go is not going to let me waste precious *speed*. 


If I wanted a quick practical script, Perl, Python, and PowerShell all exist. 


But am I going to pull up to a street race in PowerShell, **Go asks me acusingly**? 

## On Adoption

So before I take my place among the **Fast & Furious**, I need to make peace with iteratively learning Go.

My recommended steps to adopting Go are:

1. Write a bit of code and run the program. Go is **fast**. It spits out a syntax error **fast**.
2. Read the error to learn that - no, I must not do what I have done, in the manner I selected. Go knows better. And now, so do I.
3. Search Stack Overflow
4. On Stack Overflow, find a series of short lessons in advanced computer science.
5. Scroll past posts that explain how much faster my solution is going to be, because Go requires that I follow street racing rules.
6. Discover that the function I am looking for is built in, but has a quirky name.
7. Read the function docs, which are mostly warnings that built-in functions may not do exactly what I need, or even worse, they may be **slower**.
8. Briefly consider honoring the spirit of Go with a hand-crafted artisnal function.
9. But life is short. That's why I'm coding in go in the first place. Find the syntax for the built-in function.
10. Go to line 1.
