# On Deadlines

Set a meaningful deadline and compress all the work to fit - by doing only the work that really really matters.

Blah blah blah - project plans bed deadlines. Dates matter.

Work up against a deadline is remarkably compressible.

To meet the deadline, simply deliver less. Drastically less. As much less as is needed to meet the deadline without working any nights or weekends.

(Working nights and weekends is creating more work for your future self. Only a good idea if you can be assured you will be paid overtime for it.)

Learn to promise less.
Learn to make promises that accurately describe both your best intentions and your worst case scenario fall back plan.

If there's a date attached, don't promise any with that isn't either:

+ Already done, tested and demonstrated. Or
+ You could reasonably slap together in two hours, without skipping your coffee break.

Compress your deadlines to fit.

+ Do less work.
+ Do lower quality work.
+ Deliver the key value on time.

Make a plan with your team in as much detail as they need to get comfortable. Throw away your copy of the plan as soon as the team takes ownership.

A lot of time owed to Adam Savage.  Throw away your copy owed to Mike Kramer.

Mike reserved the right to ask difficult questions about the new master plan to keep it on course.

Random additional thought: Ignore other people's fake deadlines. Find real meaningful ones and focus on them.
