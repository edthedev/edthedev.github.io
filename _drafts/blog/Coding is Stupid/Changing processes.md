## Changing processes

I typically take two one on one meetings for any change in an individuals responsibilities. First to discuss. Second for the team member to bring back questions, comments, concerns.

I also commit to not changing team-wide processes except during my sprint retrospective meetings.

Both of these are on a two week cycle, and I never miss them (always reschedule if conflicted.)

In the retro, I require every team member to chime in on every change with a vote of "strong yes", "meh" or "no". A change can be implemented with a combination of "strong yes" and "meh". But a single "no" means we take a step back from the proposed change and re-evaluate, reword, and/or discuss the outcome I am after in more detail. Sometimes a change waits a sprint and we discuss again in two weeks.

Any change I need can probably wait a month. My processes result in teams that work.

Sometimes the team convenes to suspend a resent change during a stand-up meeting. When that happens, I declare the change out of use, and we discuss and vote again (usually to never try that painful approach again) at next retro.
