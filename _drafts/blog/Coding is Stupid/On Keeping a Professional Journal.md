# On Keeping a Professional Journal

Journaling during the work day can be incredibly productivity boosting.

Keep markdown Todobitems, simply global search for '+ [ ] ' to find them later.

Use markdown format and have a preview tool handy. You'll be surprised how often a quick search, markdown preview, and then copy/paste into an email will be satisfactory to resolve a request from a colleague or leader. This protects your time for thinking about important things, instead of writing up reports.

Keep a few other files:
+ Victories.md - every day record your (and your teams) professional successes into this file. Use markdown format so that it is easy to convert to rich text for sharing. If no one is asking for the context of this file every month or three, start "misunderstanding" unrelated requests and sending it to people anyway - every month or three. It's usual to share it every week or two before the relevant "are we still working at all?" Leadership meeting, too.
+ Learn.csv - move all your Todo learn this items into this file, and remove the '+ [ ]' so they don't clog up your Todo list search. Keep a separate Learned.csv for completed topics. If you want to get family, you can turn this into a Priority Matrix document with some numbers for your values to make it easier to decide what to learn next.
