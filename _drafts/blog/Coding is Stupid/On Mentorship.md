# On Mentorship

I'm probably have a lot in this chapter about why mentorship works. 

But screw that. Do it because you owe it. You didn't ducking figure this stuff out so on your own. You learned from others who paid it forward either in direct Mentorship or books I or online resources.

If you're not also willing to pay it forward, you're a parasite on the community.

Too many developers ask "what does code review do for me", and forget that this community built their high paying prestigious job.

You're not too good to help the next generation get started. You might not be good enough to help. But you can try.
