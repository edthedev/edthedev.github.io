U of I Laptop Recovery
The University of Illinois Network Security team offers a computer registration service for campus networked devices. Registering a device used on campus increases the chances that Campus Police (with help from Network Security) can recover the device if it is stolen. Iâ€™m a big fan of this service because I wrote it for them.
