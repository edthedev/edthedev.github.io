# Stay Healthy at Your Desk

Disclaimer: These are my personal notes, for myself. Talk to your doctor, or whatever.

Credit: I learned a lot of this from Joe Yeager.

## Pack Your Chin

I learned that pushing my chin back ("packing it in") aligns lots of things, down the spine to the hips.
When my spine is not straight, neck, chest muscles catch when breathing.

## Move Your Butt

A lot of the problems from sitting at a desk have to do with not moving my rear end enough.
Standing up is good. So are leg lifts (calf raises), knee hugs, etc.
Anything that gets blood flood into the lower quadrant of the body is going to have value.
Some people wear compression socks when doing a long drive.

Do something every hour. Set a timer or something.
Martian Notifier watch has a great feature for this.

Ideas: Knee squeezes, open chest/lats, hand stretches against desk.

If you stand up, don't lean on one hip. Take a wide stance. Rock and fidget.

Foot up on desk.

Roll foot on a golf ball.

## Isometrics 

Flat hands on table, arms exetended, push down as hard as I can - makes lots of arm and ab muscles work.
Underlying idea: Your core braces your extremeties.

Pay attention to rib cage position.

Apply these actions to different areas: closing, opening, pressing.

Areas: neck, glutes, head, shoulders, fingers, core.
Chin back, shoulders back, set pelvis.
Use hips to strengthen back.
