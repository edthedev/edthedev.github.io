## One Liners

*What am I about to commit?*

>git diff

*That was a stupid change.*

>git reset HEAD .\ITProForum2019Spring.html

*Well that was a stupid commit.*

>git revert {commit hash}

*I need a git server, but all I have is a Windows file share.*

>cd \\remote\share\folder
>git init --bare

???

+ Talk about the Revert Revert pattern
+ Talk about using a Windows folder like any other remote

---

## General Advice 

*I pushed a bad tag*

> Make a new tag. Seriously.

*I know what I want the final files to look like, but not how to get it there in git.*

> Copy/Paste is your friend.

???

Why make a new tag?
- You can delete and remake the tag, but your correction may not move across your team as quick as the mistake.
- So fixing the tag is gambling, while adding a minor release digit keeps everyone on the same page.

Why is copy/paste great?
- Just make it right.
- Your history will show you got lost, and forced it right. That has value.

---

*Can I do better at staging my un-commited work?*

>git add --interactive

```

## I committed on `master`

If you're lucky, and it was only a commit or two
```
# Find my commit is named CWB57
git log
# Where I meant to be
git checkout story_0700
git cherry-pick CWB57
# Clean up local master
git checkout master
git reset --hard origin/master
# Back to work
git checkout story_0700
```
---

## I committed on `master`

If you committed a lot, and want to use commands you understand
```
# Making a new branch brings along your unpushed commits)
git branch -b story_0700_temp
# Clean up local master
git checkout master
git reset --hard origin/master
# Get back to work
git checkout story_0700
git merge story_0700_temp
# Clean up
git branch -D story_0700_temp
```

---

## I committed on `master`

If you used Stack Overlfow, you may see something more like this.
It keeps your commit history cleaner.
```
# New branch (brings your unpushed commits)
git branch -b story_0700
# Cleaner (to history) way to get caught up
git rebase develop
# Clean up local master
git checkout -B master origin/master
# Back to work
git checkout story_0700
```

---

## How to protect `master`


```
#!/bin/sh

branch="$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)"

(At the repo)
Create file .git/hooks/pre-commit with following content:
if [ "$branch" = "master" ]; then
  echo "You can't commit directly to master branch"
  exit 1
fi
```
Make it executable (not required on Windows):
```
$ chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

+ Git hooks are just shell scripts.
+ You can and should do more with them.
+ You can make your chat bot cuss out whoever broke the build or forgot to comment.

## What else can `git diff` do?

[Quite a bit][2]

[2]: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff

```
git diff [<options>] [<commit>] [--] [<path>…​]
git diff [<options>] --cached [<commit>] [--] [<path>…​]
git diff [<options>] <commit> <commit> [--] [<path>…​]
git diff [<options>] <blob> <blob>
git diff [<options>] --no-index [--] <path> <path>
```

???

- Diff can do more
- but the default target is the last commit
