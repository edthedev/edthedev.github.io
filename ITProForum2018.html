# Securing cPanel
## Outline
### Intro Topic
### Intro Self

  - This is my Alma mater: Graduated with Degree in Comp Sci from College of Enginering in 06
  - You're part of my brand.
  - We (successful IT professionals) need to pay it forward to the next students 
  My credentials:
  - Worked for NetSec for 3 years
  - Worked for Tech Services for another 5 years
  - I don't speak for Network Security, but I do speak *with* them. :)
  - Worked for Bank and Payment a processor for 3 years
  - PCI and Bank IT Audit
  - Given many nerdy talks.

### Secure your stand alone / or don't run one
### Secure your connections
  - API keys - only put them where they're needed.
  - SQL passwords (don't use sa, do set a long password, don't reuse a password)
### Validate your Plugins
  - Publisher
  - GitHub activity (recent, evidence of patches)
  - Ask an expert (message template)
  - If a plugin doesn't work out of the box, that might be good security. It's a good reason to double-check that there isn't a newer more securit plugin.
### Stuff to keep up on
  - Public comments and XSS
  - Who can upload and why not to let them 
  - What file types can be uploaded. Disable exotic stuff.
  - think about your audiences - can students upload files for professors to read, etc.
### Be a good neighbor
  - limit file uploads
  - actively moderate, or just disable comments and discussion groups
  - turn off what you're no longer using.
### Use CheckLists

  CPanel Recommended Security Settings Checklist:

    IMPORTANT: Call attention to "EasyApache Modules to avoid"

## General Principles
  - if you run a chmod command, don't miss.
  - if you install a plug-in, check the GitHub for activity: recent commits, 
## Thoughts on note from Chuck
  - 3rd party apps, plugins
  - must patch
  - please don't roll your own
  - be a good neighbor

## Raw Notes from Chuck

Common cPanel Security Pain Points?

-  The largest number of compromised host events for a single host is on an official campus cPanel instance. This is a very bad title to hold. 
- The biggest issue we had with that was in policy and management. 
- I'm pretty sure they let customers (students and staff) access parts of the admin panel I would govern more, mainly the ability to bring in 3rd party apps, add-ons, and plugins. 
- They also fell behind on patches/updates.
- I do not know if they still allow people full access to spin up instances on their own, but that was a huge issue since the admin had no specific knowledge or expectations on individual configurations.
- Now having said that, cPanel moved over to the enterprise side, and since then Security has received "assurances". 
- We actually haven't seen many issues since, so we're hopeful that it's well managed now. (knock on wood)
I guess the last gap is in visibility- whether we keep controls loose and let folks do a lot (too much?) or not, I think it's important to be acutely aware of the state of things and keep on top of any irregularities. 
- Indeed the most severe incident in the pile threatened to take the entire cPanel instance offline in the middle of the semester, which generated much ado.
Happy to hear that you're talking on this. cPanel is neat, and 
- when it's done right it can help Security by placing a whole host of disparate host instances under common management and policy, 
- in a single managed bucket. 
- But there has to be agreement on everything from purpose to features to limits (and that's really where I think it gets fuzzy).

# Why this presentation, why today?
### Microsoft Recently open sourced [much](https://github.com/aspnet) of ASP.Net
### React.Js was the [newest framework ever](http://www.isaacchansky.me/days-since-last-new-js-framework/), when it released.
### Unobtrusive Validation is amazing.

Notes from <Chuck:>

Sounds great! Ok, right to it, pain point: The largest number of compromised host events for a single host is on an official campus cPanel instance. This is a very bad title to hold. The biggest issue we had with that was in policy and management. I'm pretty sure they let customers (students and staff) access parts of the admin panel I would govern more, mainly the ability to bring in 3rd party apps, add-ons, and plugins. They also fell behind on patches/updates. I do not know if they still allow people full access to spin up instances on their own, but that was a huge issue since the admin had no specific knowledge or expectations on individual configurations. Now having said that, cPanel moved over to the enterprise side, and since then Security has received "assurances". We actually haven't seen many issues since, so we're hopeful that it's well managed now. (knock on wood)

I guess the last gap is in visibility- whether we keep controls loose and let folks do a lot (too much?) or not, I think it's important to be acutely aware of the state of things and keep on top of any irregularities. Indeed the most severe incident in the pile threatened to take the entire cPanel instance offline in the middle of the semester, which generated much ado.



Happy to hear that you're talking on this. cPanel is neat, and when it's done right it can help Security by placing a whole host of disparate host instances under common management and policy, in a single managed bucket.

- Layout = null tells Razor not to add Busey Logo header and copyright footer so we can include it in another page.
- @ sign invokes CSharp code.
- We did our data fetching and number crunching in the controller.
