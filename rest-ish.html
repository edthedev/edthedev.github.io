# Try a Rest-ish API
There has been an interesting debate in various communities about what a REST API library shold provide. I finally find myself siding with those who, more or less, say it should provide nothing. In the classic parlance: You Aren't Going to Need It.

I have been seeking out REST API libraries, because I *wanted* a fully complete REST API, that provides even the API bits I am too lazy to write. The thing is, I only *needed* the bits of the REST API specification that I was actually willing to bother writing.

So skip the library, and write most of it by hand. Use some helpers for routing and serialization. Maybe grab a decorator to control allowed methods. Have some fun again.
